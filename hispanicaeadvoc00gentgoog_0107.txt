Tha Pleas of a Spanisls Advocase, Bk. l. 81

when there is no one to defend the cause of his sovereign’s subjects.
⁰Now, with reference to taking action against a plunderer-and
practically all these suits are against plunderers of Spaniards—we
have this titlez ‘⁸ That it may not be lawlul lor the powerlul to give
their support to litigants or to transfer the actions to themselves.'‘²
The other title, “On alienation to change the venue,'‘² is in abey·
ance here, because there is no intent to deceive in this case, where
the ambassador must either interfere or permit the property of his 76
prince’s subjects to be appropriated and snatched away before their
very eyes, although the control oi this property is ol the greatest
importante to the prince, since it is greatly to his interest to have
wealthy subjecte.

”The ambassador may go to law to recover losses, to prevent
anticipated wrong, or to protect a ward, and here it is a question of
the losses and wrongs suffered by the ambassador’s fellow countrymen
who are in the nature ol wards because absent and who have, owing
to their absence, even less power than wards. li it is a question
of guarding property, the ambassador has all the more right to in·
terlere, qfor what prevents the ambassador lrom discharging a pub·
lic trust and being the attorney in possession of property in order
to protect it? ‘And that in spite of the opinion handed down that
governors ol provinces are dealt with in the titles of the laws and

' in that passage where it is written that they shall not become involved
in any disputes, whether their own or another's. But th‘e laws are
not speaking of these independent and powerful personages residing
abroad, 'lor they were not even known until just recently. In most
points, ol course, as Ι have also said elsewhere, those governors of
provinces are comparable with their powerful successors, but this
parallel must not be pressed too lar. The latter are not under the
lawe which apply to subjects as were the governors of provinces.
They are responsible to their sovereign alone, and to him, and him
alone, they have to give account ol all their doings as ambassadors.
ln cases ol the King's fiscus, as the question was once handled here,
the ambassador will undoubtedly interfere, tsince anyone can look
after the interests of the fiscus. Further, this would be his sovereign’s
own cause. In this way an ambassador could prosecute a man lor an
act of piracy committed against the subjects of his King, even though

· these same persons had gone to law with the pirates on the charge
(and this was the question), and had them convicted in a civil process.
¹¹ Ol course, any subject whatever who had not gone to law could do
this, and this cause would be likewise the King’s own in accordance 77
with the terms ol the treaty.
