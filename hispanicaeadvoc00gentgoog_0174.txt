as a rule are not wont to be carried out without the help of con·
federates. This likewise is the common opinion and the one observed
in practice, and this opinion also applies to our case, which is a
piratical case where confederates are concerned. Moreover, prac-
tice (Clarus too teaches this) applies this principle likewise in the
case ol all crimes, at least in the case of theit and robbery. This

can be the fifth rule in the case oi our witnesses, or rather the

§Mhi The seventh is that they would be accepted in civil actions, and

· now civil action is brought, since merely the restoration oi property
is aimed at. mThus action can be taken, even though the crime
would be a publicone. ·

²1The eighth point in our defense is that they are not accepted
as entirely competent witnesses, and they are believed only when they
say what is probable. But that probable testimony is given by these
witnesses is evident from the lact that they are testilying against
themselves, ⁰and one cannot believe that a person deposes to his own
disadvantage, unless it is the truth that he is telling. Itis clear that
the testimony is probable from the fact that the opposite would be
very improbable: that a single Dutchman, a stranger, of humble birth,
a poor man, acted as leader for all the rest, who were Englishmen, as
master oi the whole expedition.

The ninth reply is thatin this case the question turns not so
much on the evidence ason the confessions oi criminals. It would
indeed be a thing unheard of not to believe the confessions oi guilty
men of this sort. ¹‘Anybody can testiiy against himself.. qIn lact,
we believe more the confession of a principal than we do a thousand
witnesses who assert the opposite.

rThe tenth reply is that witnesses a're accepted as suitable if they
are supported either by other ¹suitable witnesses or by inierences, and
here there are other inferences which have been mentioned above,
inferences based on the incredible leadership and mastery held by a
Dutchman, on the credible leadership and mastery held by Eng-
lishmen. The privateer was bought in England; here it was fitted

145 out also with everything; from here it also sailed out with all the
English confederates. Would not a Dutch master have procured
everything in Holland? The English, accustomed for a very long
time during the last war to plundering expeditions of this sort, but
now being forbidden them, still cannot desist, and have thought
of these devites for covering up their deceit; they have chosen a

deceit is proved here by the unusual nature oi the circumstances,
even by easily made inferentes. What is not “naturally wont” to
take place should not be believed. Now, is this “a thing naturally
