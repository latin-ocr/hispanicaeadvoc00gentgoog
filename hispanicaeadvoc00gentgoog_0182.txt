156 Alberico Gentili

in this case, would not lead to ignorante of this sort of a noteworthy
matter in controversy, ¹¹¹¹ as the argument is valid in passing from
time to place. In the same passage also Cravetta says that those
manifest and widely known events which happen in court seem near
at hand. iiThis statement others also make. ¹¹¹‘To have known of
the legal action taken by a man with whom one has a compactis
inevitable, and they have a compact with the navigator.

ln this way, moreover, a definite determination· is proved in
the case of some of them, and by several presumptions is proved for
the rest. ¹¹ The knowledge which tomes from several presumptions
is also called sure and complete, Μ and here there is no place indeed
for those common teathings, so say Romanus and others, that
ignorante of another’s action is taken for granted, and is established
hyan oath, etc. As the common doctrine goes, those principles do
not hold, when knowledge is assumed from inferentes. Indeed, it
would be the duty of the judge to administer the oath, and yet
he will· not administer it to a man against whom there is a presump-
tion, “if any ” presumption of law stands in the way of asserting
ignorante of the allegation, ¹²¹³ as Menochius remarks in following other
writers. Natta puts it well that without doubt proof of this sort by
means of an oath would be privileged, and contrary to the common
law. Therefore, it ought not at all to obstruet the truth. That oath
would be admitted-in the case of likely ignorante, he remarks, ⁰⁰ in the
case of probable ignorante, others say, and this probable ignorante,
Oddus, my teather, also says, does not harmoniae with presumed
knowledge.

⁹⁹ From the character of the person, as Natta and Navarrus in
common say, the judge in this case will settle the matter from the
cirmmstances of the business, on considering if the person was in a
place so remote, that knowledge of the act could not easily come to
him. But let us consider here the facts which have been set forth
above: a matter of importante, a place near at hand, a person with
the industry of a merchant, the frequent journeying of letter carriers,
an abundante of friends to give information, etc. Further an oath

153 is not administered when the question arises concerning the prejudite,

not slight, of a party contemed, as Menochius says in his decisions,
and as we read in other writers. Here the question arises, not
tonceming a slight prejudite, hut with reference to the delay, caused
by these people, in executing a sentence pronounted against the navi·
gator. (Ν Το delay the execution of a sentence is a matter of no small
prejudite,
