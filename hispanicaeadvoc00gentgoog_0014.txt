1oa Translator's Prefatory Remarks

means Digest, book 49, title 1 ς, law 19, paragraph 3.² In Gentili
there are three headings regularly. OI these the main division stands
at the end of the citation, the subdivision next below it at the begin·
ning, and the smallest subdivision in the middle. Thus the reference
to the Digest just given appears in Gentili (I.ch.1.a)² in the form
I. 19. ξ. 3. de capt. From the index whicli is prefixed to the texts of
Mommsen and Krueger de capt. can be identified as D. 49, 15 and
we at once have the complete citation D. 49, 1 ς, 19, 3. Books 30, 31,
and 32 of the Digest are cited dc leq. 1, de lep. a, and de leq. 3
respectively, so that l. 41. ξ. 2. de leq. 1 (I.ch.1.c) means D. 39, 41, 2.
Occasionally a law is cited not by its number, but by its first word.
Thus t. cotem. D. de publican. (Advocatio I.xx.b)=D. 30, 4, 11. ι
In a few cases the Digest is cited by the symbol fl, as in the Advocatio
II.xvl11.lclc where t. injuriarum. ἓ. 1. fl. de injur. = D. 47, 10, 13, 1.
The part of a law which precedes the numbered paragraphs is re·
ferred to as principium, and the last law under a title as len ultima.
Examples are seen in the Advocatio I.1.b where the citation is l. ς
princ. de capt. and in the Advocatio II. xxv. l where the reference l.
ult. de rc jud. is to D. 42, 1, 64. References to the Justinian Code
and to the other parts of the Civil Law are drawn up in a similar way.
For instance, (Advocatio I. vn. ll.) l. 6. C. de aedis. pri. = C. 8, 10,
63 (Advocatio Ι. xv. a) l. ornnes. C. de quad. praes. = C. 7, 37, 23
(Advocatio Lxx. b) I. 2. 4. ult. C. de commer. = C. 4, 63, 2, 4,
and 6. The Novels in Gentili are called Anthenticae.

The Canon Law, it will be remembered‚ is represented by the
Decretum of Gratian and by the collections made since the twelfth
century. The Decretum Gratiani falls into three parts. Part I is
dividcd into 101 distinctiones, which in turn are subdivided into
canones. Part Il is dividcd into 36 causae, subdivided into qnae·
stiones. Part III is dividcd into 5 distinctiones, subdivided into
canones.

The material which has been brought together since the twelfth
century consists of the following parts: Decretaics D. Gregorii
Papae IX, dividcd into tituli, subdivided into capitula; Liber Sextus
Decretalium D. Bonifacii Papae VIII, divided into tituli, subdivided
into capitula, Clementis Papae V Constitutiones, dividcd into titali,
subdivided into capitula, and finally the Extravaqantes, dividcd into
tituli, subdivided into capitula.

²i‘or the benelit of the general reader, a more extended abbreviation has been given
in the translation for the main divisione of the Civil and Canon Law, as Dip. for Digest
and Decr. for Decretum. Otherwise reference is made as indicated above.

²This refers to bk, chap, and reference, and applies both to the Latin text and to
the English translation. The numbers in the outside margin of the translation indicate
where new peges begin in the Latin original. Pages i-xvi are unnumbered in the

original.
