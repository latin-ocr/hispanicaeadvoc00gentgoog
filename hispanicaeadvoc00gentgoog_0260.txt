definitive verdict. flhn interlocutory decree has the force of a defini·
tive verdict, if it determines even indirectly an article looking to a
definitive verdict; if thafunction of the judge comesto an end; if
another verdict is not hoped for3 if the interlocutory decree contains
something to be given or to be done. 8But when a verdict is null
and void, it will not even be called a verdict. Therefore‚ the execu-
tion of it ought not to be ordered; when ordered, it ought to be can-
celed; when carried out, it ought to be reconsidered. In our case
233 nullity will the more check an execution, since the execution even of a
valid verdiet would be checked in this case, for I have said that these
eight chests are at present retained to cover the expenses ol the suit,

to help meet losses. ¹¹“ So beneficent is the right of retention that

it prevails even against the execution of a verdict, and retention is
especially privileged.’‘ Again, Ι beg his illustrious Lordship‚ the
judge, to consider what l have said concerning the Dutch enemy,
for these eight chests ought in no wise to be handed over to him.
Why, if the Spaniard wishes to commit an offense against the laws of
his King, and the ambassador asks the judge not to allow the subject
to commit such an offense, will the judge not think this request of the
ambassador just? Not only the law of the King forbids all trading'
with the enemy, ibut all laws forbid it. We shall say that the Span-
iard did not know that this man whom he made his agent was a Dutch-
man, to avoid concluding that he committed an oflense, '‘since igno·
rauce is taken ior granted, at least for the purpose of excluding the
hypothesis of an offense. Consequently, we shall conclude that we
are not to understand that a mandate was really given because of
this error in the character of the person of the agent, and that to this
effect the Spaniard will doubtless reply, if he is questioned, and,
therefore, that he has replied and now replies in this way, ¹because
it is a well-known and well-established rule lor all arrangements that
that which one would probably have said and done, if he had been
questioned, is regarded as said and done. Let an opportunity be
given us to ask questions. We will show clearly the Spaniard's wish.
We will show that it was not his purpose to go to law with the am-
bassador, and yet why do Ι drag in the ambassador here, against
whom I find no decree handed down? Against whom will the execu-
tion οἱ the decree be made? ¹¹¹The execution of a judgment is not
directed against a man against whom the judgment has not been given.
234 But if his Lordship‚ the judge, thinks that he can correct that error
which is noted in the first and second chapters dealing with nullity,
uwhich would be, as it were, an error in nomenclature, since those
eight chests are indicated in the decree by other brands than those
which they are said in the petition to bear, ⁰ l will reply that a verdict
which is null and void cannot be corrected or emended, even at once.
