CHAPTER XXII

A Letter to a Theoloqian, a Legata of the Charch, Urqes That the
Contested Property Be Sold

If Ι were able to corne myself, Ι should not be writing this letter
to you; for letters do not make answer if any exception is taken in
favor of the other side; while Ι myself should make reply‚ il I were

. saying anything in your presence and it did not in your ¹clear judg·
ment seem sufficiently well grounded. But it so happens that 1 am
forced to stay at home owing to ill health. You, therefore, in your
kindness will read and with your learning will examine my view,

three days or three hours be restored to possession.

We have won many things so far in this case by good fortune,
or perhaps through the culpable negligente of our opponent, even
because he did not urge making a new valuation, to give rise to fresh
delays, as he might have done most neatly,² either on the ground
that a valuation never becomes an award, or because, having been

made previously, it was made for another purpose. Then, too, he
does not insist upon the accepting of new bondsmen, as h'e might very

not to be bartered ofl, are not held to their bond now that the sale of

the property has been made permissible by the award of the judge.
