CHAPT ER XV
Of the Rejection οἵ α Judqe Held in Suspicion

Appeal has been taken so often from the interlocutory sen·
tences and verdicts of this judge, and so many appeals from him are
pending that Ι think it lawful and right for us in this case to reject
him. This case which we have now, and in which we are rejecting
him, is not a new one, ⁸ so that the law, which compels an appellant to
plead another case before the judge from whom he has taken an
appeal, does not compel us to plead before the same judge. Indeed,
action for possession has been taken as a result of confiscation, in
order that property which hasbeen confiscated to the Spanish fiscus,
and is now claimed by right of ownership‚ may be handed over to it.
In this case neither will action be taken on another point, nor does it
arise from another case, nor does it arise between other persons.
Therefore‚ because we are not interested in another case, and because
the law is not against us-indeed, is on our side-my argument is
from the other point of view.

bUnder a judge held in suspicion it is dangerous to go to law,
as our doctors and authorities say. “Even if no law had been passed

by man especially about this matter, reason would very easily
show, that we ought to avoid and escape by all means in our power

the judgments of those whom we hold in suspicion. This is what
Covarruvias says. Consider too the fact that for this reason a
186 very just purpose has led to the arrangement that no one be forced
to take a judge whom he suspects, dand the law says: “Because it
is our wish to have all trials proceed without suspicion, let him who
thinks that a judge is under suspicion reject him, before the trial be·
gins.'' Ι know that these statements are not taken of an ordinary
trial like ours, hut Ι approve the general reasoning presented here,
and l apply it to this judge of ours, who is under very grave sus·
picion, and against whom other reasons arise which make him liable

eAre not a hundred reasons noted, for which a judge may be
rejected, and are there not other reasons which I have mentioned
against this judge apart from this matter of appeals? This judge
has always been the advocate of these people against the Spaniards. j
