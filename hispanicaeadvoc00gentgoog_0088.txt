forth. Let the case be established. Let them show that trading was
lawful, as they boast. Then nothing will be asked for except the duty.

But it is all claimed under the law. lt is claimed here under the
law. mmAnother judge is bound to carry outa verdict given else·
where, as all our learned men teach. But if he is bound to carry out ¹
the verdict of aman, he is, without doubt, the more bound by the
verdict of the law in our case. 1²¹²ll person brings suit anywhere
under an action which is complete in itsclf, so that there is no need
of a document from the judge, if suit is brought by an action under

’ the law. ⁰⁰ This principle holds, also, for different categories; for
the law, which is based on natural reason, both teaches that justice
should be rendered to everybody—it applies, too, to different cate·
gpries—and holds everywhere. Every prince or judge is bound
to render justice to anyone who asks it, since this is the office
of justice, an office which clearly comes from the natural law which
is in force everywhere. Now, no one will deny that if a man who
owes money is absconding, he can be summoned before a tribunal

Ι anywhere. All these points Covarruvias mentions, and he discourses
on other matters.

⁹⁹Besides, in addition to him you will notice Ancharanus, who
states that, if a vagabond can be brought before a court anywhere,
much more can a man suspected of flight, since flight, as is quite
clear, suggests a delict more than vagabondage does. tn This view
of Ancharanus is followedby Romanus, Alexander, J ason, and the
others in general, however Aretinus may assail it and rail at it. On
his side, perhaps, there may be one or two. ¹² Still one point, which
Jason notes in another case, will perhaps be urged against us, that it is
not lawful to summon to court a foreigner passing through the coun-

00 try with my property, nor to have my property taken from him.
Therefore, in our case it may not be lawful for the Spaniard to
have his property seized for him here, or for him to summon here
before a court the Dutch or others passing through the country
with his property.

But the reply is easy and takes more than one form: that this
ruling may not be correct; that it applies when the fugitive can legally
be brought to trial elsewhere3 that it does not apply, if the judge who
has jurisdiction over the fugitive brings the suit. ⁸³Further, prop·
erty may always be sequestered, and sequestered property may not
be released, unless surety has been given that the party concerned will
appear in court and that the property will not be dissipated, etc.

Where shall the Dutch be sued by the Spanish Ambassador? The
Ambassador, who represents the King, seeks justice here, a judge
himself of certain fugitives here, and without doubt always a proper
person to stand against anyhody in secking sequestered property.
