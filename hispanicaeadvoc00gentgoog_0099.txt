CHAPTER XVI
Of the Edict of the Kinq, Bindinq Those Unaware of It

ln times long past the question arose as to whether booty captured
by a general of the enemy after the sovereigns had signed a treaty of
peace really became the property of the captors, provided that the

generals did not know of the treaty. This same question arose and
was again discussed shortly before this present generatim, and now
it is before us.
⁸N0w, my contention was that the booty could not have been
captured, or rather bave become the enemy’s who captured it. And
as it appears to us now, that question is quite idle for the following
reason: Clear and unmistakable stands the edict of the King, by
which any hostile action against the Spaniard is forbidden after
April 24, and after that day this capture of booty took place which 69
bas now corne up for judgment. And although the opposing side
might urge a very probable ignorance of the edict, since they were
far away from here on the high scas, still, even without the edict and
in spite of their utter ignorance of it, the same principle of law seems
from our discussion mentioned above to hold good, and therefore
the same necessity of restoring the booty exists. bFor, though the
saying is current that the law is binding after two months have
elapsed, and that in consequence positive law may with impunity
(as it is aptly put in the Barchardica of Damasus) be ignored for
two months3 cnevertheless the judge may decide athis discretion
when the law becomes binding. ‘¹Now, the sovereign certainly had
¹ the power to bind those unaware of the law, although no moral blame
or penalty would be attached to them. eThen, too, it was his inten-
tion to bind those unaware of the law, since he indicated a day after
which men should be bound under it. This is the common view. We
are speaking now of an obligation that has no penalty attached.

a person in the place where the knowledge is general. Knowledge in
civil cases does not prejudice an absent person in any way. Other
statements to the same effect are found in the commentatore, but they
