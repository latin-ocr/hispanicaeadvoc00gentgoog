228 Alberico Gentili

lenged and invited an unavoidable and serious action for damages
against themselves3 entirely unavoidable now owing to the fact that
they gave up and kept silent on that appeal, ¹as a result of which the
appeal naturally is seen to be not seriously meant. But it does not
beseem you, your Excellency, to take note of these things which can-
not touch you, since you occupy too high a position lor the sayings
of men of low degree to reach you. You have won. Do not look
farther for revenge.

Farewell, and let us even express our thanks to his Worship,
the judge, because he has meted out justice to us at last, and so favor-
ably. One thing more, your Excellency. mThe judge might have
supplied what the advocates lacked. He might have followed to our
disadvantage certain royal letters which he produced, and which,

227 strangely enough, are said to favorus and to have been secured by
us. Here your junior advocate and likewise your agent acknowledged
defeat and threw up their hands. I, however, did not yield, but took
the opportunity offered by the words of the letter, and showed to the
judge that they were not conclusive in the present status ol the case.
The judge was persuaded to our advantage, you must admit. F are·
well, again and yet again, your Excellency.
