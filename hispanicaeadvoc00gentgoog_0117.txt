The Pleas of a Spanisla Advocare, Bk. l. 91

it, sufler the same penalty. The phrase does not refer to those who
merely know. Now, there are certain cases in which the mere knowl-
edge of an oflense prejudices your case. Among these this case of
ours is not mentioned in the books, as appears lrom Menochius,
who recounts them. Consequently, uas our writers usually argue,
this case would not fall among those. But could our opponente show
in this case any knowledge ol the unlawful goods on the part of the
English who were owners of the lawlul goods, and could they main·
tain that this is one of those cases where mere knowledge prejudices
one’s cause? Therefore, I conclude my argument concerning lawful
goods with confidence, ³ for there is nothing in Imola's opinion. He
thinks that the laws which mention the smuggling ol dutiahle goods 86
and enact that non-dutiable goods are not subject to line or confisca-
tion do not apply particularly to the case of lawlul and unlawful
goods carried together, and, therefore, the parallel fails, and lawful
goods may be subject to confiscation, as the doctors maintain. This
difficulty of ImolaI would resolve by simply saying that all the other
doctors hold and set forth the opposite view. However, other reasons
also which I have given elsewhere, and which the doctors give, go to
prove the accepted view.

Now l corne to the second point which in general would go to
protect even the said unlawlul merchandise. The English were cap·
tured en route, before they reached the place whence, as Cynus says,
they could not turn back. Therelore‚ the property is not subject to
confiscation, because they could return and repent, as Cynus reaches
in commenting on unlawlul merchandise. They could reluse to sell
at Constantinople, or tell me, who would have forced them to sell?
yIndeed in commenting on the aforementioned laws ol my oppon·
ents, the learned Suarezius in a case like this one ol ours makes this
plea in defense of a Genoese ship which likewise went to the lands ol
the Saracens with arms and other contraband goods, and was cap·
tured on the way. “ If anyone shall have sold,” says the law. No·
tice that it requires a completed act. The other laws too call lor the
'completion of the act, as we see in Suarezius. ²Thus in the case of
the statute which forbids the exportation ol grain or anything else,
the law is the basis ol the cominon opinion that the statute and the
penalty imposed by the statute take ellect when the article hasbeen
exported, not while it is being exp'orted and is on the way. My posi·
tion is not weakened if in connection with this statute a usage is
urged contrary to the opinion ol the expounders ol the law, since a
usage would have to be proved, lor the establishment ol which at·
the most we trust the testimony ol learned men only lor the places
and times in which they lived. To be sure, the cautious Clarus him· 87
self speaks to this effect: “With us the practice is observed with·
