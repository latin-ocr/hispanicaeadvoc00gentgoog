197 CHAPTER XVII

Of an Action sor Possession to Cover the Retention of Property;
of Cancelinq a sequestratos· of a Jura‘tory Bond,
and of Acceptiny Certain Bondsmen

That 'one who holds possession ought not to be disturbed in his
possession, both the doctors say, and it is undoubtedly the truth.
bLikewise it is ce'rtain that disturbance results, when one cannot use
his possession freely, cfor possession means the use of a thing. dln
like manner they say that use is interfered with by a sequestration,
that hindrance and annoyance are caused to the possessor, that in
fact he is robbed in a way by sequestration3 ‘that therefore, custody
ought not to be granted, but that bondsmen are enough to safeguard
the property, which the judge will not bring under his control on the
pretext that there is danger of a very serious temptation, unless per-

’ chance proof be given of this danger. ‘Even the spreading abroad
of reports is disturbing in the opinion of everybody. gIn short, the
interdict, beginning Utrobi, which we have interposed against thern,
is granted to prevent a judicial sequestration. hlt is given against
one who causes a disturbance by judicial procedure; it is given against
one who causes a disturbance when he is not in possession.

Now, our adversaries clearly do not have possession3 they say
they have been robbed‚ kand therefore they do not have possession.
We have established our right to possession, ¹since it is enough to
have proved the right at the time when the suit was brought, or the
disturbance made. ¹¹² We did not have to furnish a regular proof either
that we do not hold possession by violence, in a secret way, or by
sullerance, ¹² and we are not even forced to show title for our posses·
sion. ⁰lndeed‚ in a doubtful case just and bona fide possession is
taken for granted. 1'Good faith is taken for granted, at least when

198 a just title resting on purchase precedes. qGood faith is taken for
granted even when a stolen article has been bought, since it is taken
for granted that the wrong deed, the act of another, was unknown.
Therefore, since our right of possession and the disturbance caused
by our adversaries have been proved, what remains except ‘that our
‘adversaries should be told that they must cease annoying us both
now and in the future, and that they should be lined for the loss

caused to us by annoyance in the past?
