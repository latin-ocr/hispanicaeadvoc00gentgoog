164· ’ Alberico Gentili

says Hostiensis; witnesses from a long distance, and those who ate
not near the court, says ¹Oldradus, and with these writers the other
doctors agree. Here, too, the judge would have no discretion in
waiting for witnesses and proofs from a long distance, however
thoroughly prepared they might be. rnA proof is not immediate
where a person has to set forth the right of one who gives and the
nature of the thing given; when something has to be proved in the
domain of law, or something in the realrn of fact3 when something
has to be gathered by the interpretation of words. ²¹ Minuteness in
the way of fact or of law requires a somewhat careful investigation.
[A proof is not immediate] when the question of law or of fact in·
volved is not easy; when arguments do not agree; when the doctors
do not. 0The documents themselves which are said to constitute an
approved prooi, if they call for some proof from outside, are not said
to furnish a proof at once, provided one has to debate the documents‚
provided it is necessary to examine the witnesses. There are other
points which the doctors usually teach.
All these points count against the Dutch, who oller questionable
witnesses and documents‚ and through these witnesses and documents
161 they submit what they consider immediate proof. A proot is not
immediate when one must debate it; in this case the Dutch will have

a very protracted debate. They wish to prove that the goods were

bought for them in Brazil‚ were transported to them, were turned
over to them. And here they submit letters from Brazil‚ witnesses,
documents‚ and marks. But we shall have to investigate everything,
and examine the witnesses, and look into the validity of everything.
And can everything be done at once? Absurdl Or they will say
that it can, for the reason that' it would be enough it everything
would apparently be done. 1'Indeed, they teach and essert that we
must observo with great care that a third party, when he is to show
that his interest is involved in staying an execution, satisfies the situa-
tion in doing it in some circumstances (when there is no damage or
slight damage involved) by taking an oath; he satishes the situation
in other cases by oflering proof not very exact, and not necessarily
very conclusive, but only ot aprima facie sort; that in a summary in·
quiry like this one the rejection either of witnesses or oi evidence would
not be allowed.

qStill to these points I make the reply that in ecclesiastical
matters they hold and are taught; that they do not hold in secular and
civil cases3 'that besides the doctrine is, Ι say, that this prima facie
evidence ought to be half complete; nay, even complete, according to
some writers. In this case, at least, complete proof is required ol the
Dutch, since there is a serious presumption oi their bad saith. Here
a necessarily conclusive proof is required, since the question in dispute
