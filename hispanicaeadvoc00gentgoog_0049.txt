The Pleas of a Spanish Advocato, Bk. l. Ἴ 23

by the owner of a field does not have to do with the security aliorded by
the state, as a change of territory does. Ι too have answered this
point in the chapter immediately preceding. ·But what do we say
to the principle ol law which I too have laid down elsewhere, that
anybody and everybody is bound to hand over to the victor the
property and the person of the vanquished? It is quite evident under
this principle that the territory ol another ought not to be a place ol
succor to the vanquished. But in the same passage my reply has
been that this doctrine may be affirmed in the case ol a complete
victory, not in the case of a small success. And here it does not
follow that, if it is lawlul for a victor to try to secure the spoils,
it may also be lawful per se for him to take them, or even that he who

rtrles a territory may always be required to turn thern over to the
victor.
