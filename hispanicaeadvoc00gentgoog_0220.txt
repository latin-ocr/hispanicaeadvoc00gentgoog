of witnesses.” Thus Fulgosius expresses himself in the single case
190 of witnesses, and even in that case he does not wisely depart from
the common opinion, since (eas Bartolus and Baldus explicitly

respond) the admission ol witnesses always creates a certain preju-
dice. ‘furthermore even from the slightest injury one may appeal.

glln appeal is taken from an interlocutory decree, “the proof of
which can bring prejudice or the injury from which cannot be done
away with or repaired in an appeal from a definitive decree,'’ says
Romanus. Baldus in addition notes several cases ol appeal which
are lawful in this connection: when the interlocutory decree brings
an execution with it; when it excludes proot 3 when it changes a benefit.
These cases fit our· situation very well, since to our detriment the
execution of the judgrnent which has begun is stopped by the admis-
sion mentioned; we also are prevented lrom proving that they are
not third parties. But l hold that an irreparable injury results from
this admission, and from any other admission ol persons, hbecause,
as Baldus shows, when once admitted, they can never be rejected
again, either in the hearing of an appeal or in an action for owner·
ship. Thus it would not oppose my argument, if anyone should allege
ithat an interlocutory decree may be recalled by the judge to whom
appeal has been taken from the definitive decree, because the power
to recall all interlocutory decrees is reposed in him. There is no
difficulty in this first question, where the opinions are common and the
reasons clear.
ln the other question several points create a difficulty, ¹‘ although
a revision is called an appeal of a certain kind, and ought to be con·
sidered in the nature ol an appeal. ln the first place, a difficulty
anses, ¹because while a suit is pending a petition for a review would
not be lawful, andan interlocutory decree does not interrupt a suit,
nor does a suit cease to pend in consequence of an appeal-at least
not in consequence of an appeal fruman interlocutory decree, ¹¹¹ what-
ever may be true to the contrary in the case ol a definitive decree.
The laws are clear: ‘¹ To petition while the case is pending is not ,
191 lawful‚ unless the publication either of the proceedings between the
parties or of the decision be denied.‘’ Here, then, two cases only
are excepted, and ours is not one of thern. Further: “He who has

failed to make a lawlul appeal must forever keep silence, nor ought
he impudently to ask aid of us by a petition, etc.” Secondly‚ where
there would exist the ordinary remedy ol an appeal, the extraordi-
nary remedy of a petition would not hold. This is also the general
rule, and here there is a place undoubtedly for an appeal, as I have

said, and it is not lawful to neglect it, as we have heard. nll peti·
tion is never admitted where an application can be made. This is

the teaching ol the doctors. ⁰The third point is that a review would
