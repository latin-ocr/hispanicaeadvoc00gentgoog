204 Alberico Gentili

if he swears that he does not think that, since he is a foreigner, he can

find bondsmen, this fact would be proved in this fashion.
Consequently, there will have been the more reason for this

bond, inasmuch as bondsmen who could be found for the party con·

cerned have been ollered, for it is evident that he does not hesitate
to give the bondsmen whom he can find. ⁶⁰⁸ ‘¹ Forbearance and con·
cession in the case oi difficolt acts is not difficult,” is the dictum, even
provided bondsmen are not found. But if these bondsmen are not
accepted, who are said to have been accepted in other even more
serious cases, ‘¹⁶⁶ and if it is not taken lor granted today that they

are weak, and if in fact they are approved as suitable by several
highly approved persons, and if even there be a suitable guarantee
of their suitability; surely it is ⁸the judge himself who is now acting
to prevent the party from having bondsmen. e“ll bond is sufficient
which satishes the law and the man, or the law at least. ‘ffThat
person is a suitable bondsman who possessos a good deal even oi per·
sonal property, or has several debtors. Resides, those who are will·
ing to guarantee the suitability oi the bondsmen have real property
also. No hond is suitable, if this one is not. If a party ought to be
accepted on a simple juratory bond, why not on this one, when the
party will swear that he cannot provide otherwise, that he cannot
give other bondsmen? εἰςΑ wrong will be done to the party and
to the bondsmen il suitable bondsmen are not accepted.
