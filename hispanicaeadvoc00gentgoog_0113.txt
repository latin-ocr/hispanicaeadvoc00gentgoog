CHAPTER XX

Of an Enqlisla Ship Sailinp to Turkey with a Quantity of Powder
· and Other M erchandise

If this question were raised in our country, as the advocate here
in ordinary ol the Spaniards, Ι should either argue for the Spaniards
or say nothing for the sake of truth. But the question at issue is be·
ing examined in Spain, where it is surely not unbecoming on my part to

publish something written by me in defense of my English friends,

whether this count against the Maltese or against the Sardinians,

when even the Spanish ambassador here, Pedro de Ziiriiga‚ a man

noble, eminent and distinguished for all the other virtues, sent to Spain
· a commendatory letter in behalt of these same Englishmen.

The facts are that an English ship, laden with a little powder, a 81

whether already made up or not, for it would be hannful to the
Roman Empire, and would approach treason to furnish the heathen, '

stronger. But it anyone shall have sold any kind of arms anywhere

diets of our holy religion, we decree that all his goods be straight·

this effect are the other civil laws and their expounders. They forbid
the doing of that, which in the present case is said to have been done
by the English, for no Christian will deny that the Turks are
heathen. c“Today by serious-minded men people who are not of
