side, ‘and so the Greeks say, “those who have given untrue or con·
tradictory evidence in support of the two parties to a case are pun·
ished by the archons concemed.” ¹ In like manner the Latins use
the expression, to give evidence anda verdict for someone (dare alicui
testimonium, sententiam), etc. Undoubtedly that is a gloss of
Cervottus‚ ¹'who never wrote a single good gloss. In fact, in·
correct glosses are commonly called Cervottine. Ι have in sup·
port of this gloss the name neither of Accursius nor of any other
good old glossator. Accursius in that connection understands the
lau, as we do, to apply to him who contradicts himself and thereby
lessens the credibility of his testimony. Indeed the laws which Accur·
sius cites on that point show us his opinion. ¹These laws apply to
one who vacillaret so as to discredit his testimony, to one who gives
contradictory testimony, not to one who discloses testimony to the
parties concerned. In this way F ranciscus, a learned man, and the
highly esteemed son of Accursius, and the brother of Cervottus‚ inter-
prets the point with regard to contradictory evidence; Accursius had

styled it opposing (adversa) ; Ι Bartolus calls it conflicting (diversa),
and he explains it as applicable to a witness who has made conflicting
statements in support of the plaintiff and defendant, in support of
the parties in conflict. I note too that Bartolus and Accursius inter·
pret thus law 16, De testibur,² by law 27, De leye Cornelia de falsis,²
and, conversely, the latter by the former. Now, in the one case we
have prodiderunt, in the other praebuerunt. At this point Ι add that,
it in the law prodere testimonium means to disclose testimony, itwould
have been to no purpose to add the expression about each party, since
the same conclusion would have followed, even if the witness had

141 disclosed his testimony to one party only, and not to each party.
Look at the reasoning of Fulgosius, which applies equally well to
evidence disclosed to one party only. Ask yoursclf what other inter·
pretation you can give it.

Meanwhile I add to the authority of Salycctus and Hartmannus
the opinion held by everbody ¹tbat evidence would not be under·
stood to have been ascertained as a result of such a disclosure, be·
cause not even a disclosure is understood to have been made, on ac-
count of its uncertainty. Therefore, Ι conclude with Salycctus that
“ much less ” is the evidence understood to have been ascertained as a
result of that advance announcement, with Baldus that one ought

“much more ’' to say that the evidence has not been learned as a result
of that advance announcement, since from such talks “no ’' certainty
² can be had. Itis also true that in this case there may be a change
of plan in the advance announcement. [Ι hold] the same view ¹¹¹ as
Hostiensis and others, that a man is not to be depended upon simply
