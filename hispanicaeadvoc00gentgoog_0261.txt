The Pleas of a Spanish Advocato, Bk. ll. 235

¹’A verdict which is null and void cannot be confirmed. Furthermore,
a subsequent verdict‚ which has confirmed theone mentioned, is null
and void, and that poiht about the error in the marks is not the only

one which renders this verdict null and void, as has been said. His
Lordship‚ our judge, who is an ordinary judge‚ clearly like an ordi·
nary judge, can take this matter up for judgment again, and conse·
quently‚ he may take it up again. But let him listen to us it he does ⁹
not wish again to make a decision which is null and void. ‘¹An
exception, based on nullity‚ is not properly an exception. Therefore,
itis always offered in opposition‚ even when every exception is lor·
bidden, and no preceding decree' strengthens it, nor does the confession
of a party concerned, although the efficacy of a conlession is so great
that a judge may lawfully pass from any stupid process ol law what·
ever to any penalty whatsoever, even to the penalty of death.
