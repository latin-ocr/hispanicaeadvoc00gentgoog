made by the individual were made with no intent to introduce a
change; which is not presumed, unless this is expressly the point taken
into consideration. The rather should this expression be considered
superfluous than that a departure from the law was contemplated.
, And other arguments which are read everywhere in all the doctors-
these arguments Ι have read in Cravetta and Cephalus. The latter
makes the statement—striking, from our point of view-that,
however the case may be in contracts made according to strict law,
in those implying good saith, the case is entirely as I have said in
view of the presumption of perfect good faith. ‘¹Now, a contract
involving a lease ora commission does imply good iaith, eand all
118 contracts that come under the law of nations are of this character;
tand, therefore, a contract involving a lease certainly comes under

the law of nations as does one involving a commission‚ ⁸ii all im·
plying good saith come under the law ol nations, and a commission
certainly implies good saith. ‚

Then consider the fact that our countrymen made the ·contract

in this case with a prince, hior contracts with princes, as everyone
knows‚ all imply good faith. Yet why, pray, do we talk oi any con·
tract here where the Tuscau took over the ship by requisition and , ,
did everything else by requisition? iThe one who obeys the requisi-
tion oia master is not thought ol as acting of his own free will.
Thus, there is uo force iu the second objection, based on the nature
of leasing, because we have a commission here, ¹‘in which case he

· who gives the commission makes good any accident and damages to
the person who takes the commission‚ and he who was not held by
any obligation recovers all these things, as Salycetus explains, in the
greatest detail oi all writers.

Now, all these considerations are not affected by the agreement
regarding hire which constitutes a leasing, as Panormitanus notes,
because when he speaks thus it is of those who “ come ” for hire;
he does not make a statement to apply to our people who were sent
hythe Tuscan under compulsion; yea, whose ship was sent under
compulsion. Pennensis likewise gave this reply regarding those act-
ing against their will in such a case. ¹Further, this subsidiary con·
tract is said to be part ol another, the principal one, and accordingly
it has the same legal standing as the principal contract, even though
it would perse have another legal standing. ¹²¹ This procedure is the
more equitable and beneficent and should he followed where things
forming a whole are concemed.

Ii this ship was lost through the fault, however slight, of the
trustee or his men, it is unquestionably true that the person who gave
the commission will be responsible, as we find in Panormitanus whom
Ι have mentioned and in Hostiensis. And here it is believed there
