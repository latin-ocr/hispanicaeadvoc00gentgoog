not apply. Then‚ too, I do not even find that opinion in Hostiensis
and in Butrius in the passage on c. 1, De testibus,² which Felynus cites.
But in general it would not apply, nor would this assertion be made
by F elynus in the case when it is lawful even to bribe a witness, ior
would anyone reluse to give evidence in the presence of a judge who
can use compulsion, unless he is led to do so by a bribe? Menochius
expresses himself to this effect: “But here there will be need ol care
on the part ol the judge in making an examination‚ and in deciding,
from the standing ol the person concerned and the sum ol rnoney
given, whether it is probable that it was given by way ol pay lor labor
and expenses‚” and in this situation Menochius wishes to have it possi·
ble to give more, and he grants the judge discretion about what has ’
been given, although he does not propose that he have discretion about
what is to be given.
