b'e delayed even when it injures the right of the third party? This
is what Cravetta responds and what Covarruvias thinks, and no·
body has expressed a different opinion. iWhen a verdict does not
injure, a third party who is concerned may come forward and make
opposition alter execution has begun. But here it does injure.

kIn a case of doubt a verdict should be so interpreted as to
injure less the third party-so as not to injure him at all. But here
we are not in doubt, since we have accepted opinions. ¹Accepted
opinions do not leave the matter in doubt, but make it clear, mor
if we follow arguments of the sort [made by our opponentsj, surely
nothing will have been so clear that it cannot be obscured. In addi·

183 tion 1 shall make short work of the argument here, that if one ought
to pass judgment in this way in a case ol doubt, so thara verdict

may not injure a third party, for the reason that this would be the less
injurious course, by affirming that on that ground the execution of
the res iudicata in this suit for possession will not be hindered to our
prejudice, because it is this that would be the less injurious course.

Without violating any ol the rights ol our adversaries, execution
can be made lor us. ¹¹ To delay it is a matter ol no ordinary preju-
dice. This is a serious matter and ol public importante, that the au-
thority ol res iudicatae should be frustrated in this way. ⁰Even whcn
prejudice has not been done to a third party, still it does not follow
from that that execution should not be made. ¹²Now, in this case
slight knowledge is enough when a third party resists the execution
of a verdict, since his right in respect to the property has been
observed in an ordinary trial. ‘¹In this case our adversaries ought to
be condemned, and condemned to pay the costs ol the entire action
against the navigator. They have allowed the ambassador to be
tired out by the navigator, and now they come forward to bring ac·
tion on their own account concerning the same matter. This prin·
ciple is thoroughly accepted, says Ancharanus, in order that in this
way we may check the spiteful acts ol individuals and needless ex·
pense. Cravetta holds the same view also, noting that an opportu-
nity to transgress would be allorded by the judge, if an execution
should be hindered in this fashion, for others in their reliance on a
precedent ol this sort would contrive similar cunning devices. ‘Exe-
cution is not hindered because an action has been moved and exception
made which requires somewhat carelul investigation.
