192 Alberico Gentili

scribe that a case ought not to be determined by a judge under sus·
picion‚ and numberless reasons are accumulated on this point, on the
’ acore of which this rejection may be made, and besides them the dis·
cretion of the judge in this connection is still to be considered, who
may admit other reasons also. rEven a slight reason ought to be
accepted, as the decision of the Rota, given by my learned friend,
Cantuccius, has it.
In fact, the argument makes it improper for a judge to be ac·
188 cepted in these circumstances, even when other judges are associated
with him, because an appeal cannot be taken from the verdict of all
these judges, and, therefore, the reasoning of the civil law will not'
hold, which forces one to take legal action before the same judge
in another case, because appeal may be taken again. Still the first
reason mentioned is convincing, because here there would not be a
different case, ³ for the point mentioned in the law which has this pro·
vision concerns a separate case, and one which does not have organic
connection with another. This reasoning is conclusive also in the case
of an ordinary judge. tAn ordinary judge, they say, cannot be re-
jected, but one may ask to have judges associated with hinr. Although
this is true that an ordinary judge may not be simply rejected, for be·
ing under suspicion, as another judge may be, still it is not true that he
may not be rejected even for a just reason. No one maintains this.
¹¹ In fact, everybody says that it would be correct and would be the
common conclusion in the case of an ordinary judge not liable to re·
jection. But the principle does not hold in certain special cases. The
judge is rejected in this case which very largely and almost entirely
depends upon a certain article of law, the situation being that this

judge, formerly an advocate, defended· that view which, if it pre·
vail here, will clearly defeat our whole case. A state of mind, as

we all knoW, may affect even opinions.
