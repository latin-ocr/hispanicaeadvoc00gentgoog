Tlre Pleas of a Spanish Advocate, Bk. I. 19

set in hunting. While he was fast in it, I removed him and took him
away. Ι do not seem to have taken your boar away, do 1? And if
1 should have loosed him and let him go into the woods, in that case
would he bave ceased to be yours, or would he continue to be yoursi
Let us see whether he was fast in the snare so that he could not
free himself by his own efforts, or whether he would have freed Ι
himself by a longer struggle. He has become mine if he has come
into my power, but if you had let him go back to his natural wild
state, in consequence of that fact he would have ceased to be mine.'’
Furthermore, Ι observe that what has not “ corne into ” my power,
has not been acquired by me, even if it has been captured. It is
not mine unless it is captured by my hands, Bartolus and the glos·
sators in common remark in that connection, although, writes 17
Albericus, in the matter of usage in the country the views of Martinus
and Hugolinus are followed who actually think the boar mine as
soon as he is unable to free himself. Now, with reference to usage,
although this is said to be the practice in hunting, still it does not
determine the law in war. ¹

A person who is on the point of being captured is not regarded
as captured, and he who hasbeen merely captured will not be thought
of as secured and brought under the right of ownership of him who
makes the capture. ²¹ Customs deal with an actual situation, and do
not, therefore, admit extension in the matter of place, persons, or
situations. ‘’Therefore, the usage must be established for that kind
of a case which comes under discussion. ”Resides to show that a
usage exists involves very great difficulty, ‘¹ and there hasbeen a vigor·
ous dispute on the point whether we ought to trust a doctor who
testifies concerning a usage, indeed whether we ought to trust several
who unite in testifying about it. Their opinions do not serve to
establish the usage beyond their own time and their own district.
These points I noted on this topic and on the other topic about the
decision of the soldiers, which was taken up in the preceding chapter.
Even in the case discussed by Cephalus, those pirates had been cap·
tured‚ and the question arose, by whom we should say they had been
captured first.
