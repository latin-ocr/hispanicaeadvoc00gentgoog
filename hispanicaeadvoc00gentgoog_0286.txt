260 , Alberico Gentili

would not even be called a legal fiction, ⁰⁰⁰⁰ lor it is not indeed a
fiction, ⁰⁰⁰⁰ and even a legal fiction itself is the truth. ⁰⁰⁰⁰ The election
was opposed, or rather the objection was made to the candidate of
Menochius that he suffered from a certain deformity, on account of
which under the Levitical law he could not have been chosen to the
ministry ol the altar, which Menochius‘ client desired. Menochius
says that today such regard is not paid to deformity. We hold the

same view that such great attention is not paid to periods of time
today, when in the first place there are very many bachelors, and when
263 in the second place this youth could have been made a master before
reaching the periodos life during which the statute provides that can·
didates are to be questioned on grammatical matters only. lt is a
severe statute if it allows one to be admitted as a scholar of this Col·
lege ⁰⁰⁰⁰ only in case he can now be created a doctor under the common
law, and thus be in the College oi Doctors; a man who can perform
other duties in the commonwealth itsell. But neither ought severity
to be taken for granted nor severity in a statute, ⁰⁰⁰⁰ for severity is
exacting justice, harsh, the greatest injustice, the greatest torture, etc.
Resides, has the statute thus far been interpreted in any other
way than I say it ought to be interpreted? Let a case be shown ol
the formal rejection of anyone on the ground that he has not exceeded
the seventeenth year, provided he was in the seventeenth year. lt
will be easier to point out individuale who have been admitted at an
earlier age. Let an investigation be made. I pass over what is very
often mentioned here, i.e., ⁰“ftlrat it has been wont to occur very
olten at Toulouse and Avignon that an election to a college is an·
nounced owing to a bribe, in which case the statutes are violated, and
the great crime of simony is committed. But the statutes are observed
most scrupulously‚ most strictly, to the very dotting ol the i’s and the
crossing of the t’s, when places are to be allotted lor nothing. And
shall nothing be granted as a favor to the father who makes the re·
quest, a father who has in no wise deserved ill of the Academy?
And as a favor to the King who, fora second time, and with a
greater right to be heard, requests to have the boy accepted, shall
not this concession be freely made? And will they not listen to justice
which l have shown to be clearly ior the boy? ⁰⁰⁵⁰ A just interpreta-
tion prevails even over an exact meaning. I have set forth the just
interpretation, that in our case the year begun should be accepted
in place of the completed year, ii that is just which is in accordance
with the law, and this is the interpretation oi the law ⁰⁰⁰⁰ Further·
more, not only the authority of the law gives words their true and
exact meaning, but this meaning should be taken on the warrant oi
264 him who fixes the law, that such and such a word should be under·
stood thus in such and such cases.
