will not endure this attach on the commerce of England. He will
refuse to have the English robbed through his instrumentality of
that which their own King gave them. This same great Duke ol
Tuscany will laugh out ol court those considerations which make
against this commerce.

Do we not hear that everything else is brought forward against
our clientsi A certain argumentation oi ours against Hanseatic
people shall not here in the present suit be twisted against us; in
this present case, l say, where commerce would be blocked forever‚

116 it the reason ior hostility toward the Turlc were felt by the Tuscan
to last forever; and it would be blocked, not by war, but-the ab·
surdity of it-by mere raids; and it would be blocked when there
is absolutely no question of Tuscany's salem, etc. Now all the
contrary considerations were present in that Hanseatie case.
tThe doctors are very prudent in saying that an argument based on
precedents is weak for this reason, among others, that we do not know
the exact circumstances ol the cases cited.

Then we have the consideration that our King does not have

, any perpetual enemies, so that it would not be fair ior him to be bound
against the perpetual enemies of others, since the Tuscan is not
obligated in this way to our King. Or, if our King has perpetual
enemies, pray‚ will the Tuscan consent to be obligated to our
King against them, against the Roman Pontiil?
