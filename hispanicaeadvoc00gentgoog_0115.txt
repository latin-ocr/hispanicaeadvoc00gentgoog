The Pleas of a Spanislr Advocate, Bk. 1. 89

that they should do unto you. hThis rule is nature's own and a per·
fect pattern of the law of God and man.’' This rule holds here where
others are bound by the precept not to do this disadvantageous thing
to the English, ἰ33 13 333 103313 13 3133 rule. Others are bound not to
do this disadvantageous thing to the English, and the English are
bound not to do it unto others.

Look youl You may establish the same doctrine by the articles
of the peace contract and of the treaty of 31113333 made with Spain:
¹‘“ Likewise, that neither nation shall furnish or consent to the fur·
nishing by any of its vassals, subjecte, or resident aliens, of aid, coun-
tenance, or· counsel, direct or indirect, of supplies, of instruments or
munitions of war, or of anything else whatsoever that could support
in war enemies private and public of the second party and rebels
against its authority, of whatsoever sort they 333, whether invading
the realms, home-lande, or domains of the second party, or with·
drawing from obedience to it and from its control. Nor may the
subjects or aliens, of whatsoever 333103 03 quality they are, whether

· 03 3133 pretense of intercourse and commerce or any other suitable
pretext whatsoever, aid in any way the enemies of the aforesaid
princes or of any one of them, or furnish supplies, arms, engines of
war, mortar-picces, instruments for carrying on war, or other war·
like equipment. Let those who shall have violated these provisions
understand that the most severe punishment will be inflicted upon
them, such punishments as are inflicted upon those who break treaties
and are seditious.” The provisions of this contract seem especially
clear against the English in this case, for it is held as certain that
the Turks are enemies of the Spaniards and, therefore, of the Sar·
dinians and Maltese. The Turks are at war with the Emperor,
who is the relative of the Spaniard, and who is explicitly named
among the supporters of Spain in the words of the thirty-fourth peace· 84
3331313. Consequently, it is also clear that he is included in the said
treaty of peace with the Spaniard. ¹Furthermore‚ Ι would seem to
have written elsewhere that all Christians 333 33 war with the Turks.
Likewise Ι observe that the Spaniard is one of the allies of the
Emperor, and that the Emperor is battling with the Turk for those
lands over which the Spaniard has the right of succession, so that in
this way it interests him too, not to have them taken from his family.
Resides, the Turk would now also seem to be an enemy who may
invade the home-lands of the Spaniard.

Now, these consideratione influenced me strongly to express an
opinion adverse to the English in this case, who from all sides were
carrying forbidden articles to the Turks, to the enemies of the Span-
iards. ¹¹²As Comensis writes, merchants often sin in this respect.
