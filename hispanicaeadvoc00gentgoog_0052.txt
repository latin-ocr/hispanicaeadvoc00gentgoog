26 Alberico Genua·

there with impunity, which would be correct too in the light of what
has just been said, even though Clarus may not regard it as correct.
Consequently he does not accept the view of Bartolus, who says
pthat a thief found here with stolen property taken in theft in
another place may be punished even here, for, justas with a change
of owners added to the continuous stealing a new action for theft is
taken to inflict punishment upon the guilty party, so with a change of
territory and jurisdiction a new accusation would be made to secure
the protection of the state.

That the opinion of Eartolus is accepted by the assessore as
useful to the commonwealth and in accordanee with the Gospel;
that it is put in practice throughout the world; that it has led to the
hanging of thousands of men; that it is approved by the council of
Naples3 that it is a common doctrine; and other considerations have
been reported in Clarus and corroborated in the additions made to
Clarus, qwhatever many, without cause, against the public weal and
the commonly accepted view, may think and say to the contrary.

Still it is not necessary here to argue about this view, for all
the authorities think this3 that, let the situation regarding punishment
to be inflicted on a thief be what it may in a new territory, still rif
in the new territory the act continues, there would also be an
offense committed against the new jurisdiction. This present ques·

24 tion has to do with a case, where, although the original actis past
and gone, the action still continues, because by this route through
the English Sea and through a new jurisdiction force is being con·
tinued, force, which it was lawful to begin elsewhere, is exercised here
unlawfully. He holds by force who continues in possession by the use
of force as well as he who has gained possession by the use of force.
The Dutch should give up all use of force here and the goods of the
imnidicis which are still free should not be taken away from them

p ere y orec.

’ ‘Even in the discussion mentioned above those who oppose
Eartolus admit that a thief should be sent back to the place where
the offense was committed3 further, that the property should be
taken frorn him and restored to the owner. To these opinions we
also give assent here. The reasoning of these men too makes it appear
that a strange territory does not protect thefts, ete. tCastrensis
well says that a man who has been robbed would have ground for
action against the owner of the place which received the thief. ¹¹ Now

I cite Imola literally, who has replied to this effect and says it is
“certain '‘ that it is not lawful to conduct a captive through an·
other’s territory, and indeed this conclusion of his is general, although
, the particular case was before him of one who had been unjustly
seized and was besides a native of the territory. ¹ And Bellus too
