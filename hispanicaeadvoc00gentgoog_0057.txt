Tlre Pleas of a Spanislr Advocato, Bk. l. 31

passage before us Archidiaconus discourses in this fashion. Or if the
man who speaks in this way does state any conclusion, he does so,
as l have said, in his last utterance. ¹³⁵ Panormitanus makes the same
observation in discussing an opinion of Innocent, even when innocent
stated a second view in these words: “But others give a contrary
opinion.’' ‘⁰ However, these words do not usually convey the view of
the man who speaks, even if they stand at the end of his discussion. But
this would be the case, when an earlier view was in the main supported.
Other things being equal, the last statement is to be accepted.
‘¹⁶ Upon another remark made by Baldus, Rolandus put it cleverly
that Baldus does notsseem to support this view: on the other hand,
Rolandus reports at the end of his argument that the doctors hold the
same view, indeed hold this very opinion which he thus gives at the
end. Rolandus also says that reliance ought not to be put on certain
remarks 01 Jason, who depends on the dictum 01 another person,
since the other person expressly holds the opposite view. ‘² These
cases are undoubtedly very frequent. 01 a' certain gloss, Felynus
writes: ¹¹ “The whole world cites it; yet it rather proves the opposite
point, because it directly establishes the contrary view, and holds fast
to this contrary view.” Shall we not say the same thing 01 the passage
01 Archidiaconus before us? ‘⁴ To state frankly what I think,'' says
Oddus, “1 have been surprised at the doctors who cite Baldus to this
effect, etc.'’ ⁸⁸ And in another case, Menochius, in opposing Decius,
Parisios, Socinus, Vasquinus, and Covarruvias, says: “Itis surely
remarkable that these famous expounders of the law have arrived at
this conclusion so rashly, without weighing properly the passages
cited by them.” And in this way Menochius shows that their authori·
ties are not pertinent. And so it stands with Archidiaconus and his
whole school.

Furthermore, Oldradus does not seem, if he be earefully studied,
to make that statement, and this Socinus likewise maintains, n for
Oldradus says: “What of theman who hasbeen seized and is being
led through a church3 suppose that he is dragged out (note Arch, 30
17, qu. 4, sicut antiquitus²).” And similarly he expresses himself
in a supplementary note to the consilium, as it were heedlessly, and not
with regard to the case covered by the consilium. ιιΑ statement which
is made carelessly is not the real view of a doctor. These state·
ments in fact apply also to Albericus, Caepolla, and to other writers,
the more so to Decianus, since he wrote in this fashion in that
handbook of his, a work brought out after his death, unrevised and
incomplete, a book in which he does not mention Clarus and the
other writers I have cited as being opposed to the view of Archidia-
conus. :r Clarus is a man 01 great discernment3 he is accurate in mak-

ing quotations, and a doctor of sound learning.
