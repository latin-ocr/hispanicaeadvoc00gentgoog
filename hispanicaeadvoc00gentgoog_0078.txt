price of it to the real owner [of the stolen money]. ln other words,
in these cases also the price takes the place of the thing, and the
thing takes the place of the price, ¹¹¹ as Menochius also, following his
predecessors‚ teaches in the case of usurers. In common with him
and with others, we hold this view the more concerning thieves
and stolen goods. l note, besides, that this delinition is applicable
in this instance3 ¹¹ for l know that in other cases other distinctions are
made in deciding whether the price takes the place of the thing. ⁰ It
takes the place oi a thing which does not exist and has not been
given for value received, and such a situation we say exists here.
”We do not say that a piece of money coming from the price of a
stolen thing is stolen, but we do say that it takes the place of the
thing.

Furthermore, this man cannot be defended on the ground that

50 he was not aware of their piratical status, since this supposition
would not be probable in the case of a man thoroughly versed in
affairs as he was. ‘¹Now, with reference to a man who has bought
from a thies, the opinion has been expressed that people ought to
enter into business relations with prudence, so that they know the
men with whom they have dealings and what their status is. ‘A
man is held lor theft, il he knows that a thing has been stolen and if
he receives it, buys it, or wins it at the gaming table, 'and in a doubt·
ful case, he is presumed to have known, because he ought to be cer-
tain of the status of the man from whom he gets it. tThe man who
has dealings with another ought to be sure of the status of the thing
for which he contracts. It holds good also even if he did not know,
because he ought to have lmown. And these conclusions apply also
in their bearing on court proceedings.

Furthermore, the point always holds against this enemy of the
Spaniards that, although he had taken Spanish property from our
pirates, still he would not have made the captured property his
own until he had brought it within the lortified lines of his country-
men. Whereas we assert that what had been taken becomes 1444
here in the territory ol a fripndly King, that it is free here.
