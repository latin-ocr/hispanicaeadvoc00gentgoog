CHAPTER XXXI

Of an Appeal from an Incidental Judqmenr in a Casa 01
Temporary Possession and o( Provinq
a Suitable Bond, etc.

. A LETTER TO Α FELLow-nuvocnte

The matter has been finished, it is true, as we wished, but the
judge was right in replying that those arguments which you offered
on the impropriety 01 appealing in a case 01 temporary possession are
general and subject to many limitatione. ln my response I· noted
the fact that the case at issue was not 01 a possessory character, but
involved an incidental point conceming the acceptance of hondsmen.

although one is not granted in the case 01 an actioh 101 possession.
Thus your arguments were outside the present inquiry. Most learned
man, always remember to notice the form which the question takes,

any faults. You shall hear the faults which the other side has
committed. I have told the story to the ambassador in a letter.
Here l add to you one point, which concerns your aforementioned
allegations, that the other party did not appeal 110111 the decision
01 those who valued the merchandise in controversy. cYet they
could have appealed from this verdict‚ although they could not have
appealed from a verdict in a case 01 temporary possession. dThey
could maintain that it was lawful 101 them to appeal again within 252
ten days from the interlocutoty decree establishing bondsmen, and
could allege new reasons 101 appealing. Good heavensl what
mistakes have been made by our adversaries, or what mistakes are
being made by me in this estimate 01 their errorsl Other mistakes
01 the parties concerned in the action itself 101 possession l neither
mention to you, whom they concerned at that time, nor do Ι com·

if you continue asking, I shall tell you that the party concerned could
