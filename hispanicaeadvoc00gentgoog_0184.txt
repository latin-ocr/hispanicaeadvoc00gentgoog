CHAPTER VIII

That a Third Party Suspected of Brinqinq an Action in Bar Foith
Is Not Allowed to Delay the Execution of o Sentenee
Pronoonced against Another

Those who ‘knew or are presumed to have known of an action
in which a second party is concerned and of the sentence pronounced
against him, and have kept silence, seem to bring an action in bad
faith in opposing afterwards the execution of that sentence, and
ought therefore in no wisc to be listened to. In this way the evil .
intent is proved on the part of those who, for the sake of tiring the
litigant out, come forward so late to ward off a judgment which they
believe will fall upon thern. bBad faith “is shown to be evident ’' in
the case of one who takes various appeals at various times, just as it is
with one who brings several actions for one sort of offense (see Jason
on Code, De transactionibus²); “malice,” in the case of one who
for the first time in these circumstances interposes an appeal never be·
fore made, especially when it is essential and fundamental, especially in
the case of one who possesses property. He has other points of this
sort. All these considerations count in this case where the Dutchmen
at one time carried on all their legal actions through the navigator,
and now wish to act for themselves. cA person who keeps silence
about his real right seems to do so with evil intent, as others also
teach. Cravetta says that evil intent is taken for granted, it slowncss
in coming forward to delay an execution is shown on the part of the
third person wh0, knowing about a trial at its very beginning, has

154 postponcd opposing it until the case hasbeen settled, in order that he
might in this way inconvenience the victor, so that, when nothing is left
him except to see to the execution, then of all times the business might
go back to the very beginning, although the suit was just over. He
says that it is very probable that the new action was postponcd because
the third party thought that the law was not on his side3 “also that
suspicion of bad faith arises from the fact that the third party comes in
when the situation is desperate.

And would not the situation be desperate for these adversaries
of ours? They have had this one anxiety, to conceal themselves. to
have it said that everybody else owned and possessed the merchan-
dise. But, since the navigator hasbeen defeated in that suit, these
