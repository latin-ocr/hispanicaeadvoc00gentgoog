cianus upholds him. Menochius also says that the man is considered
elected “by everybody, by the common consent of everybody '⁹ who
has had cast against him only two or three votes. Do we need more
arguments against a precise, superstitious, harsh, and infiexible inter·
pretation of the statute? m¹¹¹Statutes ought not to be interpreted
in the Judaizing manner. This is a common remark ‘⁴ Even ii the
world is quite full oi these Judaizers, although they may not bc Jews,
still it is a shame to the world, so to speak‚” to use the words of
Baldus. However, if the person mentioned is thought of as elected
“ by everybody, with the common consent of everybody,” although
he had three votes against him, this young man too may be elected
who lacks months only to finish seventeen years, even if the statute
with greater strictness should require the election of him who has
completed the entire seventeen years “without any break whatso·
ever.” ¹¹¹Thus the argument holds in passing from persons to
times. Do we still argue, or do we delay longer after having quoted
clear decisions in specific cases?

Now, what has been said, or can be said, in opposition iumishes
no objection. We can see that these arguments have been reiuted
and are inapplicable to our inquiry. What has been said oi thc
words “to be completed ’⁹ is not an objection, for the reply hasbeen
made that the seventeenth year is understood as completed in our
inquiry‚ and to have completed is not to have exceeded, but something
less. ns “ But should one have exceeded the fourteenth year to be
able to make a will or is it enough to have completed iti ” ln this
way the law interprets the words “to complete ” and the word “ be·
ginning.” ²²² Consequently, some people have been able to interpret,
even of years entered upon, the statement which the laws make about
the age of contracting marriage, namely, that a woman ought to have
“the full number of,” a man ought “to have completed‘' the years
specified. ⁸⁸⁸⁸ They are not even refused by the fact that the words

261 ‘⁶ to complete ’¹ cannot be taken oi things entered upon, but for other
reasons. It is a beneficent thing that in that situation tbe year cn-
tered upon should not be regarded as complete, in order that there
may be a fuller and better considered deliberation in this important
matter, and in this grave servitude-bbbb that is the phrase—oi mar-
riage. ⁰⁰⁶⁰ The same sentiment is expressed in the case of spiritual

¹ marriage on account of the very high condition of religious profession.
cldddHowever, a day begun is regarded as complete even in mar·
riage‚ as it is in the case of a will. Some people are not troubled
either in ordinary practice ii a week is lacking, ior if the lack is
a slight one it may in ordinary practice be called complete. Un-
doubtcdly when wisdom takes the place of age, in that case attention
is not even paid to years. Suppose we should say the same thing in
