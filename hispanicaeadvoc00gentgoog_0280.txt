was not ordained a priest in due form who lacked about lorty
255 days of passing beyond his twenty-fourth year, no matter how little
the one who ordered his ordination thought there was in those days;
because the candidate for ordination ought to have finished that year,
that is, tothave passed beyond it and touched his twenty-fifth year,
says Navarrus. And there are other statements to this ellect and
very many statements about the strict interpretation ol the statutes.

However, these consideratione are not decisive, and l think
that the opposite view in the proposed question is in harmony with
the law, so that that youth, for example, may be elected to the college
in accordance with the statute. Now, Ι am led to adopt this view
by the consideration effla, the doctors without exception give as
their opinion that, in the case ol gifts and honors and beneficent
things, itis indeed sufficient to have touched the year; and that in
those cases time begun is regarded as time completed. This view too
Panormitanus says is the common one, although he himself thinks
the law is otherwise.

Resides, no difficulty is caused by the fact that the law ex·
pressly mentions the completion ol the year3 ⁸⁸ forsit is certain that
statutes are brought under the interpretation of the common law.
¹¹¹¹ This gives rise to that definition among others, in this matter ol
elections, that if there is a statute to the ellect that a man is to be
elected to a college by the consent ol all, the statute, in accordance
with the common law, is understood to mean “ by the consent oi the
majority.” Statutes receive this interpretation, which is called “pas-
sive,'’ from the common law. This is the general view ol all with
reference to the law omnes populi.²

iiThen, too, we are right in getting this result by wresting the
words of the statute from their usual meaning, in spite of the lact
that there is a statute to the eflect that statutes are to be inter·
preted literally. kkNow tos, concerning this statute the view is
expressed that it has little or no ellect. lllt is the casuistical inter·
pretation alone that this statute excludes; it does not exclude that
which is in accord with the common law. Μ For this is not only an

acceptable, but also the necessary interpretation.
256 ¹²¹¹ Statutes must be understood according to the cules of the law,

and never in such a way that they become at variance with a case
decided according to the common law. ⁰⁰ The wording of statutes
must be brought into harmony with the interpretation ol the common
law. ⁹1³ We must understand statutes in harmony with the art oi
men of letters, and thus there are countless cases in which there is no
doubt. Ι note once more Baldus's statement about electing by the

consent' ol all, and that this statute is to be understood, in accordance ·
