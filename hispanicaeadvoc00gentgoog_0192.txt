CHAPTER X

Os Marks, the Letters of M erchants, and Other Documenrs from
tha Collectors of Ravenue; and of Proof of Owner·
ship and Possession

Brands, “they call them marks (marchae), stamped on bundles
and on chests of merchandise do not furnish lull prool of the owner·
ship of the merchandise3 they furnish a presumptive and unreliable
proof, as Straccha well puts it, and on this point Menochius and the
others teach the same doctrine. But even before Straccha others
have taught this, so that undoubtedly this is the common view.
¹³⁴⁶ The letters ol merchants in accordance with usage are said to
have the force of public records, and are accepted by everybody.’'
cThis is true, too, ol the documents from the collectore of revenue,
dbut these letters, to be used as proof, must be acknowledged.
However, it is an accepted principle that letters not acknowledged are
certified by a comparison [sc. with other letters where the writer is
known]‚ and the same practice would hold for account-books.
eIn the case of receipts the principle would not be the same, unless
the said receipt, which has not been acknowledged, has the signatore
of three witnesses; with another receipt it is not possible to secure
acomparison. And the reason lor the difference is that the party
interested in the case of a receipt ought to take the consequenccs upon
himself if the business was not carried out in due form. On these
points Straccha holds the same opinion, and concerning the comparison
ol the letters he also mentions something else to the same effect,
which 1 do not set down. ‘Other writers too remark in the same
way on the difficulty ol proving a private document, even a docu-
ment between merchants. All these points I note against the Dutch
in this case, who wish to oller a full and immediate prool of their .
ownership and ol their possession by those processes which are unre-

163 liable and call for a somewhat careful investigation. Here Ι cried
· out in a manner not mine, but that ol pettifoggers.

⁸It is more difficult to acquire possession than ownership, and
hownership, even ol personal property, as Purpuratus says, is very
difficult to prove, and, ias Purpuratus and others remark, almost
impossible. kVarious things are needed for the prool, namely, of
ownership. ¹That the transfer has taken place must especially be

established, even to the extent ol a transfer of possession, ²¹² and al·
