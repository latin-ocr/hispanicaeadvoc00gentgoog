The Pleas of a Spanish Advocate, Bk. ll. 155

are taken for granted in the case ol those acts which it is not probable
that anyone would undertake to perform without instructions. There
is no doubt in the case where the master both knows and can prevent
the action. Therefore, it is taken for granted that these acts ol the
navigator are the acts of the owners, since they could have been ol
advantage to the owners. Therelore, also, it is taken for granted
that they knew of these matters.

Or perchance could they not have been informed of what was
going on here? In so many weeks, months even, has no letter
gone from here to Hollandl Has no letter come back to this 151
country from Hollandl Yet regular public letter carriers have sev·
eral times gone back and forth in this whole period. xThere are
‘¹ sufficient ” grounds to infer knowledge from the fact that the places
are near each other. Holland, where these owners are said to have
been, is distant by an easy voyage of one or two days, ³ il we
believe, as the law holds, that ona voyage fifty miles is the usual
distance for a single day. ‘Places are near at hand which are not
lar away. ⁸⁸ What is not distant more than two days by sea is called
nearby. So the judge would say at any rate, bb to whose decision
the question of settling the matter ol proximity would be assigned,
ceif the decision is to be given in accordance with the rules oi
common law, and to be in harmony with approved principles. Here
notice in addition the long period of time, as Ι have said.

ddBesides, we assume that those who have known a part have
known the rest also, as others, including Menochius in his responses,
remark. They have heard nothing about the suit? “ Let the Jew
Apella believe it.” ² But if some have known, we assume that the rest
know too, ⁸⁰ since the argument is valid in passing from things to
persons. ¹¹ Cravetta, in talking ol the knowledge of a third person
who wishes to delay the execution of a sentence brought likewise
against a second party, shows that a partner is presumed to know
the acts of a partner, and undoubtedly subsequent results, and lawsuits
particularly. He shows too that, even if there is no partnership, it is
taken lor granted that the third party knows ol the trial of a note·
worthy matter in controversy. He shows that even a long lapse
of time would not lead to ignorance of a thing of this sort. There-
fore, I would say also that it is taken for granted that a partner in
the merchandise in a given vessel would know acts like these on the
partos a partner. There is partnership in this case-this is evident
from the treatment of jettison, as well as from the proverb, “to be
carried in the same ship,” and from similar reasoning, and from
other arguments.
