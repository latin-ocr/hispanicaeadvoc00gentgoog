44 Alberico Gentili

Socinus does not successfully reply with his distinction between an
oliense which has taken place and one which has not taken place,
because after the offense has taken place, one deals also with a
benefit, that is, with the acquittal of the offender. Now, I would
say in support of Aretinus that it would be a mockery of the laws,
if it were put in the power of a manto avoid punishment by antici·
pating his opponent in making the attack. ffSo elsewhere I write
that a marriage between young people still under parental control,
consummated, but contracted without the consent of the parents,
ought to be annulled-although marriage is a thing of most beneficent
character-of course, because the children would easily protect them·
selves by this act of consummation. ⁸⁸ The matter of aequittal is benefi-
cent, when there is a doubt whether an offense has been committed
or not. But when it is clear that it has been committed, undoubtedly
conviction is beneficent, since it is for the public advantage to punish
guilty people. And here let no exception be singled out of an oliense
committed at the right time, because an offense is forbidden at any
time and is punished. ¹²¹¹ And in this way punishments are beneficent.

43 Likewise, in reply to the dicta of Socinus, ¹1which are also adopted by
others, l remark that we have not before us the case of an offense
followed up, but of fear that it will be followed up. Further, with
Bartolus Ι observe: “I ask anyone, into whose hands the present dis·
cussion shall have fallen, not to make the distinction innthis case a
public one for fear that an occasion for murder chance to be given,
etc.”² This distinction is under¹ very grave suspicion and for the
reason that it requires to be kept quiet, because it gives opportunity
foromurder. ln this'way the replies to the fourth argumentare of
various sorts.

The fifth argument does not embarrass us, because the people of
Lanuvium mentioned above set out with the authorization of the
state. ¹‘'Therefore, they were enemics as soon as that war and
that giving of aid had been decreed. In other words, in that case
everything had been done to assume the name and the standing
of an enemy. But the Britons start out as private citizens, and they
are not enemics unless they have become soldiers of the enemy, as
hasbeen said. They have not yet satisfied the condition “of being
with the enemy,” and while the condition is unfulfilled it is exactly

ι as if they were not enemics. Similarly, the common opinion is the
same in the case of the man who has been condemned and in the case
of a sentence which is pending on account of appeal. On this point
Socinus writes that the sentence passed is conditional and pending,
and “what is pending is not the same as that which is.”

¹Question 1, no. 32.
