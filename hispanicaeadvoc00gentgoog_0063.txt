The Pleas of a Spanislr Advocate, Bk. l. ' 37

owing to a formula of Roman law, with which they were not ac· 35
quainted, as Ι have elsewhere set forth the incident. Therefore, so
much the less would the second of two powers entering into a treaty
on terms of equality be bound by a usage or by an English law, not
only unknown to itself, but even unheard of by [the English King]
himself.

Ι add another point in the case under consideration. The man
who captured a Spanish ship is, of course, a Dutch enemy3 but, in
this case, he is also an unscrupulous belligerent, since he is more truly
committing piracy under letters of marque than carrying on war.
0Το the same effect is the law on similar matters: “ If [. . .] ship·

“ mates or messmates [. . .] or those who set out to plunder.” ¹’Then,
too, the history of Mithridates' leading general says that he “was
more like a freebooter than like a belligerent,” seeing that he was
wandering among the islands, leaving devastation in his wake, etc.
This predatory warfare is waged in accordance with no discipline or
custom of war, a war against non-combatants and harmiess merchants,
and others situated far from the battle lines, Ι although it is only what
takes place at the front that really seems to be done in war. ‘This is
the substance of my full treatment of the proper law of war against
armed men in my books “On the Law of War.’' These books 1 men·
tion with no lack of modesty, but to the end that men may know 1 bave
always held these opinions.

'Now, Ι know that it is the King's business to determine what
limit he wishes to put to his kindness, and yet Ι would dare to affirm
that he had no desire whatever· to show any kindness to these pirates,
3ηά to reduce the boundaries of his jurisdiction by means of that edict.
The King would not have limited himself for the sake of those
wretches‚ who thus would have been able to widen the field of their
depredations. ‘Therefora neither could this be the interpretation
of the edict, that those might be advantaged whom the King, the
framer of the edict, certainly had no wish to advantage. And yet,
why should there be discussion on this point? This same captured
ship was brought within those new boundaries which they mention,
and rode here at anchor, 3ηά even lay in port. And further, the
prisoners were brought on land, and then taken back on board once
more. ”Therefora not only within those boundaries, but straight 36
into the strongholds of the pirates might the officer of the King have
followed them, since they offered violence within these boundaries
to a captured ship and to captured people. And, of course, on the
very instant that the captured ship carne within these boundaries, it
became safe from all violence. ¹ It is in this way that one “is at
once understood ’‘ to have returned by postliminium on entering within
friendly boundaries. And Ι note those words, “is at once understood‚”
