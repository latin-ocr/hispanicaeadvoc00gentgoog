'which speak for themselves, and there is no need here for the ruling
of a judge. Imaintain that just as it obtains in postliminium, it
would hold good likewise in the jurisdiction of another, and that on
entering it, they [the prisoners] would be sale from violence. And this
‘jurisdiction it was the duty of the magistrate to defend, 'else it
would have appeared to his own great detriment that he had ap-
proved of what seemed a private jail. For it did seem like a private
jail, when the Dutch detained Spanish prisoners within the territory
of our King. Therefore, our magistrate was justified in suppressing
unjust violence and punishing it. “Officials who do not check at·
tempted forbidden acts suffer punishment. Then, too, how does it
concern the prisonem, if someone or other has offered violence to the
Dutch?

“l“ If you were to dispossess me of property by violence and
thereupon Titius should take possession of it, l cannot enter an
injunction against anyone but you. Il a bandit should drive the
holder and usufructuary from his farm, and on that account the
usufructuary should not make use of the time fixed upon and thus
lose his rights, no one doubts that the owner, whether he joined the
usufructuary in an action against the bandit or did not so do, would
have a right to retain the usufruct thus reverting to himself, and
that what the usufructuary lost would be at the expense ol that man
by whose act it was lost.'’ cclbnd to the same ellect are other laws
and bits of evidence.

Then, too, that other argument ol my opponents about restitu-
tion made to those robbed has nothing in it. The Dutch could have
been molested without prejudice. They did not suller violence3 they

37 were restrained from violence, ⁶⁶ etc. Exceptions such as this to the
rule that the person robbed should receive recompense are frequent
enough, so far is it from being the case that-as my opponents main-
tain-this ought to take place without exception. ‘⁸ Even in the case
of persons brought before the court the officials apply no other prin-
ciple than this de facto extrajudicial one. Let the Dutch, let everyone
enjoy the use of the sea, but without violating the jurisdiction ol
another nation. ¹² Let everyone remember too that there are limitato a
joumey by sea as well as to every other joumey. ⁸⁸ Let them re·
member that other things, once undefined‚ are delined today, and that
the distinction made by the law of natione, of eminent domains and
jurisdictione, should be most scrupulously observed.
