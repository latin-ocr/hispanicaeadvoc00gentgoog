ι The Pleas of a Spanish Advocato, Bk. Il. 207

common view, this view which we mention would be the com·
mon one.

Furthermore, as to a suspended judgment, the doctors agree that
it is irregular to grant it in a suit lor possession. Now, our oppo-
nents in this investigation have recourse to the question of limitatione
in the following way: They assert—what is perlectly true—that sus·
pensory action is taken where the loss is not recoverable in a suit for
ownership, has others neatly explain through another suit for pos·
session. Moreover, my opponente go on to make mention of the
irreparable loss sullered by a sailor who merely has the power of
detention and is now deprived ot that by an [adverse] decision,
iand yet in a suit relating to detention the rule is explicitly laid
down that an appeal to suspend the judgment should be granted,
but 1 reply that the loss here is always reparable or else it is
not loss. Lookl Either it is of his own loss on account ol passage
money that the sailor speaks—but this passage money has been as·
signed to him so that it he accepts it as being a fair amount, then
he suffers no loss3 or, on the other hand, it he does not accept it,
thinking it not a lair amount, he will recover the loss suffered by
an hypothecary action, ¹‘by an actio in rem, by a suit to secure owner·
ship. ¹Thus also in a suit involving detention the appeal is denied
should the loss be reparable. Or else the sailor speaks of loss because
he fears the action his employers may take against him, because
property intrusted- to him has not been defended. But here either he
has no such instructions from them, so that the loss is not to be con·
sidered, because there is none, or else he has such instructions and will
recover his loss by the institution of a separate suit. Or else the

sailor is speaking of the loss suffered by his employers, in which case Ι
he either has no authority to make such a statement, and, therefore,
will not be heard, or else he has the power, and will in like manner
recover the loss for them. '
Then they dare to make a point of the possession of very

. valuable property, saying that here lies the cause ol no ordinary ·
prejudice3 ¹¹²but they fail to recognize that a suit for possession al·
ways involves merely ordinary prejudice, even though the possession
ol some great advantage be involved, even though the property pos·
sessed be ol the highest value. Then, too, they strive to demonstrate 205
the irreparable nature ol the loss because, forsooth, an ambassador
is the more powerful personage, adding that he is more powerlul
too by reason ol his wealth. ¹² And yet it has been the usage to call
the more powerful‚ not him who is wealthier, but rather him who by
virtue ol his high office can show the other man a lavor involving a
threat. Contardus, who here measures power by wealth, leaves the
matter to the decision of the judge. Why now, I pray, is the Spanish
