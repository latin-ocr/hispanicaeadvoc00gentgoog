The Pleas of a Spanish Advocato, Bk. II. 221

quence of this, would have sufficiently met the danger of the loss of
property, even if it were not perishable produce, and if this action
for recovery is not mentioned, either I am ignorant of all law, or
else the opposing advocates know nothing of any part of it. I pro·
ceed. If they should omit every argument whatsoever for posses·
sion, and make their contention on the ownership of the goods, of 219
course certain victory does not await them, but still we are drawn
into a doubtful and uncertain battle. l should make bold to support
the contention that the contested goods are not ours, but belong
rather to our opponents; scarcely in the least degree are they ours.
For what did Ι prove once in a certain lengthy reply of mine, except
that it can be regarded as utterly false that the Spaniards here have
the right of postliminium? What did Ι establish when I showed
that captured Spanish property cannot be brought either into the κ
territory or through the territory of our King? I tried to draw the
conclusion which may be thought illogical, namely, that, therefore,
the property so brought is freed. And what weight shall be placed
upon the third argument, that this same property, though captured
and possessed for days and months, has nevertheless not been
acquired by the captors until it has been brought entirely within
the fortifications of the captors? I once set these arguments before
Tarius, not, as now, on account of some other case, but because
they were correct, and they are correct now, Ι tell you, but correct
they will not be, however, if this sale is proceeded with. Uhdoubtedly
the sale will make the wares something else than they are now, and,
therefore, there will be no suit for recovery, no suit to assert owner-
ship. Perhaps a persona] action will be left open to the Dutch,

now that the more convenient real action hasbeen lost. And so Ι
might add more points which would show that through a sale the

goods at hand are saved to us and future evils are warded off. These
considerations, which are the more weighty, Ι give to your ear, but
still those are not to be despised either which Ι set down for the
judge, which I urged against my opponents regarding goods tha-t
become spoiled with the passing of the hours, the considerations
which the distinguished Doctor Taylor advanced in regard to the
fluctuating price of articles, and the other arguments of that sort.
Those wares may be sold.

And why, tlren, should they not be sold? An honorable and
fair price for them can now be received, and why, then, should they
not be retailed at the present time? Philosophers teach that a fair 220
price is not a lixed point, but may vary somewhat. Do l say, “tbe
philosophers’ ’ἓ All the Jurists and all theologians hold thye same
view. The theologi-ans give this further warning that one should

not look back or waic in the hope of securing more than a fair gain
