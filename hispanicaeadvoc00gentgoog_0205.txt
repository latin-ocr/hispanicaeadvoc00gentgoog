CHAPTER XII

On the Same Arpument concerninp a res judicata between Certain
People Which lajares Others ’

Alexander amentions many conditione which must be met that
averdict pronounced between certain people may injure others. He
affirms that the citation of the third party at least by a general
proclamation is required, and that Angelus holds this view. bNotice
also that Bologninus supports this dictum of Angelus vigorously
against lmola, who alone has seemed to oppose it, although he ought
to yield, in Bologninus’ opinion, to the authority of his teacher An·
gelus, for the others who do not consider citation necessary, we may
understand, are thinking of a special citation, so that their views
would harmoniae with the views of those who consider citation neces·
sary. ln like manner also we may understand that the glossator on
the l. de unoquoque, ff„ De re φἰιιὶὶειιιιι,1 is thinking of a special cita·
tion, for this law is talking of a special citation, just as the glossator
is in the limitation which he applies in discussing l. saepe.²

The objection may not be urged that l. saepe speaks in gen·
eral only of knowledge, because, when anything is required, all that 176
also which leads up to it and is required by the verdict under l. saepe
ought to be included. Now, knowledge calls for notification, and noti·
fication in this case comes either from a public edict or from a procla·
mation. He says further that it is wicked and cruel thara verdiet
should hold against one who has not been cited, for perhaps the
defendant would have brought forward reasons which would have led
the judge to give his verdict in another way. This is what Bologninus
says. cBut lmola does not stand alone in holding an opinion against
Angelus on this question3 Alexander holds the same view. Bologninus
has done wrong in concealing the name of Alexander, who was his
teacher, for he must have known that Alexander took the side of
lmola, inasmuch as he tries to overthrow the fundamental arguments
of Alexander. But still he cannot do it, for the l. saepe calls for
knowledge, and makes no distinction as to the source from which it
comes. There would be nothing wicked in the present case, in conse·
quence of which our opponents may complain of their treatment, since
they have known about the suit, and have not opened their mouths,
