When a res iudicata between Certain Proplr May Iny'ure Others,
Followinp l. saepe, Dig, De re judicata²

The general ⁸rule is that “ transactions between certain people
do not injure others,” and to this rule there is the note of the jurist
Simmachus, “ When have those who are absent and not informed of
a proceeding between others been injured by it? ” bThere is also
here a special rule and title that those who have not been present
at a trial are not to suffer damage from res iudicatae between others.
‘Furthermore natural reasons also are given for these two rules,
because in accordance with true reason transactions should be limited
to those who are responsible for them, and should not be extended
in their eflect. Since, however, as Cujacius says, and it is undoubtedly
truc, this rule often, though not always, holds, it should be added
‘¹that he who claims an exception ought to give clear prool for it.

A thing is said to be settled in favor of one who has the rule
in his favor. eSo in fact on this very topic others present an argu·
ment, and Alexander says: “This situation has not been provided
for by the law. Therefore, we are under the rule, since we do not
find your situation to be made an exception to it.’‘ fThe case is an
exception “when anyone allows the next in order to act in a matter,
the action or defense in which belongs first to himself.” It says
“the next in order ” (sequenti), thetis, tbe man from whom the
other has the case, as Dynus, Ravennensis, and Albericus have ex·
plained in that connection, and very recently Covarruvias asserts the
principle in detail in his “ Questions of Practice.’' These same writers
and Cujacius say that he who had been called ‘⁴ the next in order’'
(sequens) would then be called “the owner ’' (dominus) in this law.
A verdict, says Covarruvias, injures another person when in the legal
proccedings, the rights and ownership ol a litigant are dealt with,
from whom, as the real principal, are derived and upon whom depend

167 the rights or the ownership of the very person who allows this
process to go on with another. Covarruvias deals at length with
this matter, and to this discussion he applies also ch. pen, De re
judicata,² which hasbeen derived undoubtedly from l. saepe,⁸ gfor
