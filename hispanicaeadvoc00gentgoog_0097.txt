The Pleas of a Spanish Advocato, Bk. l. 71

robs his adversary of prools is guilty of trickeffemmere
has admitted his evil intent. ⁸He shows that he is supporting a s·
honest cause, etc.

hBut that constitution of Zeno is vexatious, unjust‚ in violation
of natural law, in violation oi the law ol nations3 it deprives the other
person of the right of ownership. Therefore its application ought to
be restricted so far as may be, and everybody should always refuse to
recognize the law, etc. ¹But it does not hold, unless many accept it;
and many limitations are applied to it. lThat point is much dis·
cussed which concerns the peculiar privilege granted by the law to
the Emperor, as Panormitanus says, a privilege not to bc extended
to the King oi France. Ι shall set up that limitation against the
King of Barbary, for he does not recognize or hold any part ol this
Justinian law, ¹whatever may be said to the eflect that in the Turkish
Empire the highest regard is paid to this Justinian Code and the
greatest weight given it in decisions there. In the case oi other Kings
there is no situation of this sort, lor their law is not interior to that
of the Emperor, very often it is even superior.

Ι will not add several other rather commonly accepted points
which could have been added, because Ι do not wish to dwell longer
on a point that is clear. Still I will not fail to say that, evenis they
had bought lrom the public warehouse and from public officials, it
does not follow lrom that fact that the purchase was made from the
fiscus. The purchase was made there, as the merchants themselves
report, in accordance with the practice oi that kingdom. This would
mean that the King should buy everything and that everything should
be bought of the King, as the owner for the moment, and through
some agent of his. 68

¹¹¹ But the fiscus is bound to sell property as its own, honestly,
not with an ulterior motive, if the buyer is to be saie at once. Be·
sides‚ this sale of the fiscus must be effected through an agent es-
pecially deputed for the purpose, as Alexander states in his opinions.
Itis far from true that this sale, informal and nominal in its char·
acter, is enough. The steps mentioned above ought to have been
taken and approved3 yet they were not taken, nor have the merchants
maintained that they were. Consequently the solid foundation based
on the sale by the fiscus on which the advocates on the other side rely
without reason gives way. Menochius reaches the same conclusion
in a case in which he gave an opinion, in discussing the same fundamental
argument raised against him.

Furthermore, in our case Ι would add that, il this legal principle
is set up to govem the treasury of that land, the pirates will have
indicated to them a very convenient place, which is quite close to the
Spanish lines ol trade and occupied by English merchants, where
