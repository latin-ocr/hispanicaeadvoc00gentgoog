Maranta, as well as Menochius in his books on presumptions. ¹lt
is taken for granted that the owner knows what has been made known
to the agent.

Now the captain of a ship is in a way an agent. ⁰¹“ He to
whom the care ol the whole ship has been intrusted is also an agent
who administers another's business under the instructions of the
owner.’‘ nThat factors are kept on the spot—men who carry on
the business-makes knowledge presumptive. Does not everybody
know the industry ol merchants and their very great watchfulness;
how they have trusty scouts everywhere, who report to them day by
day through the public letter carriers-through their own always in
important matters-what new events are happening anywhere? ⁰To
prove the knowledge of one who is absent it is enough to show that a
rumor has come to him from a report made by prudent and honest
men. Knowledge is proved from the letters of friends, and
such reports and such letters are regularly wont to be transmitted, as
we all know from daily experience, and ¹² from that which is regularly
wont to be done knowledge is taken for granted. Knowledge is taken
lor granted from that which a person is in the habitos inquiring into,

150 and a person naturally, qa merchant especially in view ol his occupa·
tion, is wont to inquire into that which brings him gain. ⁸ “A trained
intelligence fighting for its profits,” says the astronomerpoet, ol the
merchant. This natural presumption is considered “the most power·
lul of all,” says Cravetta, and so he remarks that the allegation of
ignorante is contrary to natural presumption‚ “so that trust in it
cannot be made the basis ol judgment lor anyone.'’ These opinions
Cravetta expresses, and he is easily the leading jurisconsult of our
age, 'as Menochius says. Pray, let someone who lives according
to the light ol natural reason (to use the words of the same juris·
consult in a similar treatise) tell me whether we can believe that
what was done was done by the navigator, while the owners of the
merchandise did not know of it. There has been a suit, an appeal, a
decision concerning the appeal, resistance to execution by every form
ol contumacy. Did not the navigator who did these things for the
owners also inform them about all these matters?

Besides, how would these acts advantage the sailor? Nay, what
disadvantage would they not cause the sailor it justice be done in that
case? tIn accordance with the well-known dictum ol Cassius oft
repeated in trials, a thing is believed to have been done by the person
“ lor whose benefit ” (cui bono) it would have been, and as it were
under his instructions, the doctors say. ¹¹ The act of a household, even
when it is unlawlul, is attributed to ‘⁴ the wish ” of the master, because
“it would not be believable ” that anything should be done by the
household contrary to the wish ol the master. Also “ instructions ”
