The Pleas of a Spanish Advocate, Blc. I. 109

bene a Zenone,² hold good and that I am contradicting myself, it I
argue otherwise. But there are dillerences between the present case
and that. ¹Note that the law mentioned provided that legal pro·
ceedings should be taken against the fiscus instead of the possessor.
Now, this principle does not hold in the case ol the fiscus ol Barbary,
which is an enemy rothe Spaniards, as l pointed out there, but it will
hold in the case of the fiscus ol Turkey, which has treaty relations
with the Venetians. Accordingly, the Venetians might and should take
action there, and, accordingly, they could not object that the matter
was now being handled outside the jurisdiction ol the fiscus that made 107
the sale in this case, since itis still being handled just as it would
be there 'in the circumstances. There are other dillerences between
the present case and that other. There not only was the purchase
made ol pirates, but the fiscus did not interpose except as a mere
matter of form, etc, and here l am urging, not so much the privileges
ol the fiscus as I am the common legal principle ol taking into account
the place ol the contract. Therelore, let that argument stand here as
follows: Thosc who are sale in accordance with the law of the place
where the transaction occurred, are sale in England also; but these
merchants are sale in accordance with the law of the place where the
transaction occurred, therefore, they are safe here in England also.
Now let the second argument be: '²¹The Atinian law, as also the
law which deals with the taint inhering in a thing stolen,8 operates
between citizens and citizens; but the present action is not between
citizens and citizens; therefore, no statement shall now be made τες
’ garding the taint inhering in a thing stolen. That law was able to
bind these men also at the time when both Africa and Britain, not
Venice alone, belonged to the Roman state. But such is not the case
now that the states are separate and distinct. To illustrate, ¹¹ Fulgosius
replied to the same ellect that the law, directing that action in reference
to crimes be taken in the place where the accused persons are found,
had its sanction in the legal principle in accordance with which the
whole world was subject to the Roman Empirc. But today‚ as shown ·
by the facts themselves and by that splendid interpreter ol law that
should in no way suffer alteration, I mean custom, on account ol the
separate jurisdictione or principalities, this is not s0, not even in the
relations of states which have mutual treaties. Not even in the relations
of states, I repeat, which have mutual treaties, as Baldus and Alexander
hold against Bartolus. Baldus says that Bartolus does not satisfy the
wise on this point, and that custom is against him, etc. But still, how·
ever the case may stand with regard to states which have treaties,
⁰where Jason and others hold with Bartolus as to the law; where states
baveno treaties, the lewis certainly as I have said. That civil law is
