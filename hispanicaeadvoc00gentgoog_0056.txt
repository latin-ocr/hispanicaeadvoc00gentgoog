Poiticrs and which, as he also says, should be followed. Gigas has
noticed that it is followed at Venice, as Decianus himself relates.

Now, in answer to Archidiaconus, Socinus replies that he does
not seem to stand on sure ground, if his position be carefully ex·
amined. This is true, ¹¹²for Archidiaconus says: “If a person be
seized by a bailili outside of a graveyard or a church, led through a
church, and taken therefrom by force, the immunity of the church
does not seem to be violated. See the writings of Archidiaconus on
Cede, De aedificiis privatis, l. si quis,² in the argument against the

= first point, qu. si quis contu, and on can. definivit,² at the begin·
ning, where you notice his hesitating words, “he seems,” and in
that connection you will notice that only an argument is given,
23 although it is a very good one. Another and an opposite view is given
later on, and it is supported by a two-fold argument from the canon
law itself, nbut we rather accept the opinion of the author which is

given last, ‘’even when he does not support it at all.

But if Archidiaconus, upon whom all the rest depend‚ either
holds the opposite view or lays down no principle, of what value
will the names of the rest be? ”A doctor, my friend, Oddus, states
that the names of those who depended on a passage in Baldus
are of no weight. “ ln reply,’' he says, ‘⁴ it is enough to weigh care·
fully the dictum of Baldus, for all of them depend upon it entirely.
Now, Baldus lays down no principle, etc.” ‘¹So also another doctor,
my friend, Clemens Nonius, in opposing Alexander and Comeus,
says that a man does not seem to make a statement who depende
upon the statement of another, if that other really makes no state·
ment. rIn the same way Menochius argues against several oppon·
ents, that reliance ought not to be placed on the authority of those
who have spoken without due consideration in following Speculator,

' since the latter was talking, not about law, but about usage. 'He
mentions similar cases elsewhere. ‘⁸‘ We take it for granted that the
man who refers vagucly to the teachings of others holds opinions of
the same character as are the opinions of those who arc cited.”

ult is a well-known and much-used principle that whatever
stands in the original is also implied in full in the citation. ¹1t is
a well-recognized principle that the dicta of learned men are inter·
preted in accordante with the laws and authorities which they have
cited, even if their words seem to say something else. yThey would
seem to have gone astray and to make no definitive statement who
report what is not found in the original. 'Their authority is worth
nothing. At least we can say here with Socinus that all these followers

· 29 of Archidiaconus reach no fixed conclusion, for certainly Archidia-
conus himself reaches none. ⁸⁸ Alciatus writes that the man who merely
states the pros and cons reaches no fixed conclusion, and in the
