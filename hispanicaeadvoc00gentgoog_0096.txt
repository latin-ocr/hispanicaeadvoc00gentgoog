CHAPTER XV

Os the English W ho through the Assistance os the Treasury of the
Kinq os Barbary Have Bouqht Property Taken
from the Spaniards by Pirates.

² The opinion is correct which I gave in commenting on the con·
stitution ol Zen0‚ that it is speaking of the fiscus of one's own Prince,
that is, the Prince of the man whose property is at stake, for all who
give an explanation of this law take itin this way, that the Prince may
take from me the ownership of my property. Now, surely this is
not true of a foreign prince. The laws are speaking of the Prince
and they certainly do so only with regard to his subjects. bFurther·
more, when the doctore say that the treasury spoken of is present
everywhere, they are likewise speaking oi the treasury of one's own

&Others speak also of the good faith which the buyer ought to show,
and they mention other qualities too which must be assumed in order
that this constitution may stand: that the Prince should have come
into possession and in good saith, das, again, others too remark3
that the buyers should be of good saith on their part. But the Eng-
lish have bought some of these goods directly from the pirates and
they knew that they were buying from pirates. eStill the fact would
have been enough, that they ought to have known it. They knew too
that what they bought there through the intervention of the fiscus
was booty left by the pirates, for they saw these. very pirates there,
and knew that allos the property must have come from the pirates,
and they recognized the same marks on all the chests. Let the judge
observe the bad saith of these merchants, wh0, when summoned here
to court, took pains to have these marks, which indicated the owners,
rubbed out and ellaced, and were caught in the act. ‘The man who
