The Pleas os a Spanish Advocare, Bk. l. 93

acquired. This is not the case with the Turks now, as everybody

surely knows‚ ‘ld although Straccha may not have considered this in
setting down the opposite view, but his conclusion is in the very terms
ol the law. '

I add the lact, too, that il any of the articles which were being
carried lorche use ol the ship were left over, the English could
lawlully sell thern. ‘⁹ So, to speak of the things which can be pro·
vided merely for one's own use, it has been held that they may be
sold, it there is no use lor them afterward.

By a fourth consideration l am led to the same line ol defense,
“that the mere carriage ol contraband is not such par se, but [it is
unlawlul], because it would seem to assist in doing a wrong, that is,
in giving aid to the Turks. This assistance, since in this case it
would be many stages removed, would not imply irregularity, to say
nothing ol any other criminal ollense. Thus, lor instance, theman
who lumishes a remote incentive to homicide would not be guilty ol
an irregularity. This is literally the reply made by a man of clear
judgment and ol eminent erudition and uprightncss. To the
same effect Navarrus, who praises the man I have mentioned, lays
down the ruling that he who builds triremes lor the Turks gives them
a very remote incentive to light the Christians. But to serve on
Turkish triremes when they were warring against the Christians
would be to assist directly in doing wrong, and it has been so char·
acterized by the canon law. Carrying arms to the Turks would not 89
be a direct wrong nor a wrong at all in this sense, to adopt the dis·
tinctions which these very writers make in following others. Have
not the Turks today various wars amongst themselves, waged both
at the gates ol the city and against the Persiansl Now, to carry
such articles to the Turks as will bc very probably used against the
Turks is not forbidden, ⁸⁸ for no one questions the lawlulness ol
helping infidels against infidels, as Navarrus and another very learned
Spanish scholar, Molina, remark. Christians may fight with the
Turks· against those who are not Christians, Navarrus says, and
he remarks that we are within the law in helping them against other
Turks. Consequently the possibility that the Turk might use these
munitions against the Christians is very remote indeed, lor he is “
rather lar away from the Christians ol that region where this ship
was or was going to be, and very lar away from the Spaniards.
Besides, in this case we can defend the opinion of those who have
always said that a penalty is not incurred il these things are carried
with no intent ol furthering an attack on Christians. The words ol
the canon law indicate this, and Navarrus adds what has just been
said about assistance, although writers commonly oller another in-
terpretation ol this law. We ought not to depart more and still
