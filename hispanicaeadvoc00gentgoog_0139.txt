l'he Pleas of a Spanish Advocato, Bk. I. 113

pirates. They are left outside. They are left beyond the reach of
any public complaint. Accordingly, they are leit 1n the general
law which deals with inlidelity and hostility Them too, no difficulty 112
is presented by the lact that goods seized by pirates do not become
their property; because this rs true only of pirates who are not ene·
miss, and not of pirates who are likewise enemies. These pirates are
enemies‚ as I say, and the Turk along with them is an enemy of
the Venetians, since he protects those pirates openly everywhere
and always. But il the goods were certainly lost to the Venetians,
what grounds for displeasure have they, if Englishmen bought them?
⁰⁰ Cannot each individual advantage himself while he is not injuring
others? Or rs the Kingdom ol England not free? ¹²⁹ The Venetians,
in answer to the complaint of the French King that gunpowder had
been bought at Venice and carried to his enemies‚ asserted that their
state was free and that no one was ever forbidden to trade there. I
likewise declare that my Englishmen are free and have not been
forbidden to trade anywhere. (Ν Το secure what does not injure you
and advantages the other man should be the judge’s continual aim, ·
and even the devil should get his due, as our countrymen say. Χ

Ι shall add one thing more in conclusion. Our countrymen have
their trade with Tunis‚ Algeria, and many another state taken from
them by this claim oi the Venetians that those states are nothing
but piratical retreats and that there is none in them but pirates and
that the very magistrates in them are pirates too. “The Venetians
were incensed without measure at the traffic ol the Lusitanians in
the Orient and atthis traffic of our countrymen they are just as
incensed.
