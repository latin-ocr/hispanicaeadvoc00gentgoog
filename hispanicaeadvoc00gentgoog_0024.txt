To the Same Person.

A good and wise man brings profit to the human race, even after
his death. Of this, most illustrious Scipione, thy brother is a prooi, a
man above my praise, and famed for his merits throughout the world.
The books which he sent forth during his life, and ten times over
corrected in every jot and tittle, these even Themis approves.
Themis approves likewise those which, death forbidding, he
could not publish. Now may affection drive thy soul on to bring
to light his posthumous works. Hence, as gratitude is due to thy
brother, the author, deep gratimde attends thee also. This noble
proof of thy brotherly loyalty and love generations to come will
