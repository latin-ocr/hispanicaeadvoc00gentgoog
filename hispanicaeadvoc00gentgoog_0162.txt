136 · Alberico Gentili

The reply to the last argument is that, in the case of an absent
person, it is a maxim that mere unswom statements hold, and yet not
without tending in that case to decrease the confidence put in the evi·
donce, lor that this testimony creatos a presumption at least Hostiensis,

134 Butrius, F elynus‚ and all late writers teach, according to Vivius‚ and
indeed they teach it in harmony with Clement. In this case, moreover,
and in certain other cases the opinion of Bartolus is held to be correct
also by others. '⁸ It is held to be correct in the case oi a man who can·
not speak, and this point Bartolus observed also, but so as to retain in
general his view-that it would not be a substantial clement in testi·
mony that it should be given by word of mouth, if it can be given
otherwise. For the substance itsell would not change. ‘³ It is com· ’
monly held to be a correct procedure it the witness in person even
read 'his testimony; in the case of an incident which is very involved;
where one fears discrepancy and inadvertence‚ as Felynus and Areti-
nus teach, and as we say for the same reason in the case ol any wit·
ness who distrusts his memory, even in connection with an incident
not very complex. It is held to be correct if the witness is not under
suspicion, for in this case the argument of those who maintain on
the other side that the truth may be inferred from the change in
color and from vacillation‚ loses its force, as Decianus says. And this
establishes the rule here, in keeping with the opinion of Bartolus‚

for such the rule would be, in order that every man may be presumed
to be honest and truthful. But there are also other reasons for holding
icto be correct which Ι pass over as less apposite here.
