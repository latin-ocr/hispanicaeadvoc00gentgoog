The Pleas of a Spanislr Advocate, Bk. ll. 173

that “mere'’ knowledge of the legal action prejudices his case
to this extent, that he may not hinder execution. All these words
are those of Ancharanus. κΤο the same ellect arc also the more
recent commentators on the law. Duarenus says that a res iudicata
injures other people who know that a person is taking action and
permit it, although they have the power to prevent it. Doncllus
also says that a legal verdict and the authority of res iudicatae make
a res dedicata injurious to him who could have gone to law in advance
and stopped the other. And in the case of these more recent commen·
tators we should notice that they follow the Florentine reading, and
yet in general also teach the doctrine mentioned. yEven Cujacius
tcaches it, and says that mcre knowledge is enough, and knowledge is
“ seeing and pennitting.'’ ²This doctrine Cravetta also teaches con·
cerning knowledge and tolerance from the same l. saepe.² ”These 170
principles, says Parisios, “the entire school of the doctors holds.''
ben other later writers also we read that “mere knowledge '⁹ is
enough, and they add that it would not be‘necessary at that point
to ask whether he who took part in the suit was a person with a
legal standing or not; furthermore‚ they cite also the points noted
in l. saepe. ⁰⁰ The man who is informed is held to be the same as
one who gives up a claim, as others put it. So this is the
line of reasoning mentioned, and taken into account by everybody
in this whole discussion-knowledge, power to prevent, toler-
ance.

Covarruvias fights very hard against all scholars in maintaining
that the exception noted in the decretal is a single case, yet there are
two and they are commonly regarded as two. However, he com·
bines them into one case, so as to prove that his third party required
in these circumstances is always present, when he who allows an action
has a case from the litigant. That case is a single onc, but without
countingthat mixed one there is another. Thus the decretal clearly
distinguishes two cases, as do the gloss and the rest of the (Μ civilists
and canonists. “ It presents the rule and two cases which arc excep·
tions,'' as Ancharanus and Panormitanus say in commenting on the
decretal, and in the same connection Zabarella observes, “ It fails in
the two cases which are excepted here.” Covarruvias is entirely
opposed to the common opinion in these discussions, entirely. eeHe
approves no reading of l. saepe.² The royal laws even do not please
him. We reject his statement that the cases in the said law are like
‚cules Reason is the rule.= Cases are cases, and do not restrict reason
or the rule which comes from reason. “The connective “like ”

(basleti), which the jurist uses in the said law, shows well enough that
t ey are cases.
