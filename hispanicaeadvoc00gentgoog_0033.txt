CHAPTER 11 ὅ

Thac Property Does Not Belony to the Enemy W ho Takes It Until
It Has Been Brouqht orithia His Fortified Lines

Thereiore I have boldly maintained another, point, and l have
argued effectively against Antonius Gama in holding that property
taken by the enemy is not acquired by him until it has been taken
clear through to a point within his fortihed lines. This is true, how·
ever long the property may be in his possession. Itis true ol this
property, held, though it was, lor more than two months at sea.
aln fact the law stipulates that it be captured and taken clear through
to a point within the enemy's confines. “They have captured and
taken it clear through to a point within their confines,” it says. Here
the expression “to take clear through '’ (perduco) deserves notice.
This expression the law has used several times. It indicates the com·
pletion of a task, bfor per indicates totality. cFor this idea the law
uses very frequently also the expression “to come clear through ”d
and it ought to be taken to imply successful accomplishment. lf two
months do not suffice ior the captor, a thousand would not. Prop-
erty must be captured and brought within the captor’s confines. Time
counts ior nothing. The law does not take it into account. Indeed
time counts for nothing in this case, where booty is always oi doubt·
lul ownership so long as it has not been taken within the captor’s
fortilied lines. The proverb goes “there's many a slip 'twixt the
cup and the lip,'’ and the nature and lot oi war abundantly prove the
truth of it, eas I have maintained at length elsewhere.

In the case which Ι took up for the Spaniards, who were taken
prisoners by the Dutch, there was a stretch oi the sea to be crossed;
there were the shores oi the enemy to be skirted‚ and the people of
these regions too were on the watch to prevent the taking of booty
and were prepared to checkmate it. Disaster coming from the
weather and the sea were also to be feared. Therefore, the law
properly stipulates that property be brought within the fortified
lines. But it is clear that a ship to which captured goods had been
brought does not constitute a lortified line, ‘for a ship is classed 6
as a movable thing. A fortilied line, however, is something sta·
tionary. ΕΑ ship does not rest; it moves, and is comparable to a
vehicle, or rather to a horse—‘⁴ He rode over the Sicilian waves,” as
