CHAPTER XXV

Of Commerce arith the Turks

‘All the laws apparently say that commerce with the Turks is

forbidden. I, however, do not care lightly to depart lrom the very
definite rule ol the law ol nations bwhich regulated trade relations
without making any distinction between nations. Now, other laws
could oller no difficulty3 they can be answered in many ways, and
always truly. Those laws, whether civil or canon, do not allect the
subjecte of England, except in this way, that the English are.not
allowed to have the trade relations mentioned with the enemies of
the Roman Empire3 these laws do not so aliect the English as to
make it just as unlawful lor them to trade with the enemies ol others
as with the enemies oi England herself. ‘Add that between princes
and also—and this is our case-between a prinee and the subject ol 115
another nation it is the practice that the civil law should not apply

lore this trade would not be forbidden. The 'sixth reply is that it
is not possible to see any evil intent here on the part ol our clients
against the Tuscans or other Christiane. The seventh reply is that
it is conveyance to the Turks that is forbidden, but this is a case of
conveyance lrom the Turks, the transport of Turkish merchants
‘lwhere gold is taken from them through the action of the civil law.
The eighth reply is that we are not here dealing with goods or
merchandise that is contraband. The ninth is that this is not a state
ol war which exists between Tuscany and Turkey; they are merely
raiding against one another. eWar is a lawful struggle and a
struggle in the full sense of the term.

The tenth reply is one that will overwhelm every opposing
argument as with a monster wave, that the Tuscan in his wisdom
