CHAPTER XXVIII

Passaqe-Money Is Owed for the Turks Capturad by the Tuscan
on an English ship

The Tuscans who captured their enemies‚ the Turks, and their
goods on the ship shall pay in iull to the Englishmen the iare which
the Turks would have paid to the English ship at the place agreed
upon3 ‘for the victor takes the place oi the vanquished, and any
and every possessor is bound by an hypothecary action, and for
passage-money everything is subject to a lien. bThe Tuscan is held

for the whole fare, no matter what may have happened with refer·
ence to the persons and property oi the Turks, notas a result oi the 123
situation oi our men, butas a result oi their own situation. eThe

“ claims upon property go with it when it changes hands. dThe victor
comes under the law that applied to the vanquished. Tell me, would
not the Tuscan be willing to accept a claim ol the vanquished Turks,
ii they had had any of a like kind on the goods oi the Englishmen?
eHe would be quite willing, you may be sure. Accordingly, he
should be willing to accept the present state of affairs, when he would
have done so if the situation had been reversed. He should be pas·
sively willing now to accept what then he would have actively willed
to receive. ‘The rule is, according to nature, that a loss should
be felt where a gain was expected. This in briei in regard to the law.
Now, if, as the story goes, our countrymen actually had an agree·
rnent to this effect with the Tuscans‚ so much the clearer and more
definite would the case for our countrymen be.

A slight addition {or the end of Chapter XXVI.-—Then, t00,

the great Duke‚ with that generosity of his which he promises our
countrymen unasked‚ will take into consideration the fact that our
men who were skilled in navigating the ship were taken frons it and .
others unskilled were put in charge of its navigation. I mean the ’
English ship which others not Englishmen lack the skill to navigate as
well as those who are accustomed to do so. Lack of skill is accounted
a fault, and ii there is even a slight lack oi such skill, the lessee too is
held responsible. This is certain. If Ι knew the men whom the
Tuscan put in charge I would say whether they are skilled; ’ἔοι he is
skilled who has thrice acquitted himself creditably; he is thoroughly
experienced‚ a master, etc. One should consider the place where the
ship was lost, to see whether a skilled navigator would have lost her
