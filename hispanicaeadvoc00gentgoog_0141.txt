CHAPTER XXIV

Of Inquisitions and the Testimony of Turks

With regard to ⁸ inquisitions the matter stands thus: They are
not held where money is concerned unless the truth cannot otherwise
be ascertained. Even in the case ol slaves this is the established prac- 113
tice, and consequently they are not held even upon a man conditionally

free or in the case ol other humble and obscure men. Free men
must not be tortured to convict them here of lalsehood, nor yet to

arrive at the truth‚ unless they are said to bc implicated in the deed and
they waver in their testimony. So say the laws; so say the doctors.
What then if our ,cliente wavered? bThe nature ol the proof
ought to be cogent, the details convincing, and so lorth. cBut then
this matter is said to be at the discretion ol the judge and there is
nothing lelt lor us to say since we did not see the procedure. ε1Ιέ
sufficient prool has not preceded, the confession which may have been
extorted under torture does not injure even those who have confessed,
not even when they persevere in their confession. Always, however,
our presumption should lavor the magistrate. But if men suspected
ol perjury and accused of crime have already been tortured, all the
’ more shall we be able to understand that the magistrate had good
reason for his action. eThe Englishmen themselves, if convicted of
perjury, committed previously and without compulsion of torture,
should by all means be punished3 hut if convicted of perjury com·
mitted under torture they shall nothe punished, since it was not in
deceit but in distress that they lied; fand where deceit is absent there
is no perjury. Their distress excuses them also lor altering their tes·
timony, which is the same as perjury. Now, I say nothing here about
condoning these confessions. gThis question has been treated fully
by Menochius and others, but I assure you that l know well the stub-
bomness of the English which leads them to prefer every·
thing else, and even death itself, to torture; while ¹1on the other
hand, it is said of the Egyptians and Cappadocians that they would
rather die under inquisition than reveal the truth‚
iThese confessions under torture surely do not injure the mer·
chants to whom the property was said to belong in the former testi·
mony. Nor could the testimony ol the Turlrs hurt the merchants;
nay, it could not injure even the defendants themselves. ¹‘The law 114
is quite definite on the point ol not accepting witnesses ol this sort
