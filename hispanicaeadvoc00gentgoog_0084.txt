Articlcr Sold in Brazil iu Violatt'on. os the Laco Are Souqlrt in
Enqland by the Spanish Fiscus

We maintain that what was sold by the Spaniards to the Dutch
in Brazil has become the property of the Spanish King, since confis-
cated property comes to the fiscus, and this property has been con·
fiscated.

⁸Confiscated property is acquired by the fiscus at once, under
the law itselI: δ’* And this ruling carries execution with it, since
this is one ot the special cases in which there is no need ol a suit,
because the penalty may be imposed when the property is found and
it has regard to the property only. Other penalties are regularly
imposed by way ol action or suit and through a verdict and execu-
tion,'’ to quote the correct statement of Raphael Comensis. ⁰ Bartolus,
and Alexander, too, state that, when the oflense concerns property,
ownership “ undoubtedly ” falls to the fiscus without a verdict.
dWhen the law covers execution, then no other execution or act on
the part of a man is needed. eOwnership is vested in the listas at
once, and he who has acted contrary to the law ceases to be the
owner, as Duarenus also says in this connection. Indeed, it is certainly
the opinion of everybody. fSo completely does this property cease to
belong to the former owner that he may now buy this very property,

65 and no one buys his own property. ⁸ So completely does it become the
property of the fiscus that the fiscus may act in this case by merely
claiming the property. And why shouldn’t he, il he is the owner?
¹¹ For the simple reason that if a man has acquired the ownership ol a
thing, he always acts in this way, as the titles of De rei vindicatione ² , ·
show, and as the doctors teach in accordante with these titles. Why
is not the fiscus the owner, if the former owner has lost ownership?
¹Ownership cannot hang in the air. 'So true are both these facts that
the property has ceased to be his and that it belongs to the fiscus, that
aman may be held to the fiscus for the price of itit he loses it by
fault before it has been handed over to the fiscus. These conclusione
are sure. ¹And we feel perfect confidence in talking ol the goods in
question as confiscated, it public declaration ol their ownership has not
been made. But even it a thing has been sold contrary to the require·

mppts of the law, [it is subject to confiscation], as Duarenus and
ot ers state.
