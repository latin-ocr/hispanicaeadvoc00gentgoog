The Pleas of a Spanish Advocato, Bk. ll. 151

¹Besides, the man who is under obligation to prove the exist·
ence of an obstacle is also under obligation to prove that he has shown
diligence, and that he has also made an effort, and that he has also

. striven with all his power to overcome the obstacle, and yet has not
been able to overcome it and to carry the action through. Also
proof should be given that he tried several times, and not on one day

, only, to weather the storm and make a landing. Further, there
should be a public statement several times of the insuperable char·
acter of the obstacle, as all those rules apply expressly to chance occur·
rences. These rules it would be safer to follow than to follow the
general distinctions.

Bnt come, let this captain prove the obstacle, and we will not
call for public announcements. Was he, las all sailors regularly do, 147
governed by the wind, tadring in this way and that, until the storrn
passed by and a more favorable breeze came back? It has not been
proved and no attempt has even been made to prove that it was
necessary to come here, to England. Furthermore‚ [it has not been
proved that] he could not have gone to some point in the Kingdom of
Portugal. To this country, to this country his course certainly lay,
since the end aimed at is learned from the route taken, ¹and the
man who carries merchandise by unusual routes, and who carries it
by other routes leading to forbidden places, is thought to be going
to forbidden places. Would any storm bring him here from those
islands andnot allow him to go to the realms of Portugal? 111Α
single storm does not rage everywhere, and the same storm coming
upon a ship in a dillerent part of the sea does not drive it to the same
place. lndeed routes by sea and by land are ol common knowledge.
From those islands one goes directly through England to Holland,
and, therefore, although the existence of some storm may have been
proved, still this storm, of which they talk, has not been proved.

Let the navigator produce the formal papers which he has.
At once the whole matter and the trickery in this case will be clear.
¹²Publication should certainly be made to the fiscus or to an agent
in behalf'of the fiscus, even for the purpose of establishing the inten-
tion of the fiscus. ⁰Navigators ought to produce such documents- ·
thetis the common opinion—especially if there be suspicion ol any
fraud, as there is suspicion here, from the aforementioned course of
the ship, that the goods are being carried to another place than that

' to which the navigator says that they were destined.

The same suspicion arises when all the facts are concealed from
the royal ambassador on his making an inquiry even about the duty
due the King. “He is doing wrong who avoids the light.” 1'lt is
also a “ common '' vice to withhold fraudulently tariffs and duties.
This suspicion attaches also to the vory owners of the merchandise,
