The Pleas of a Spanish Advocare, Bk. l. 5

liminium in time ol peace. Furthermore, in the time ol Quintius,
there had been little intercourse between the Greeks and the Romans,
and close relations between them began at that time, as Plutarch
writes. What il you were to say too that the Romans, ol whom we
were speaking, cameto Greece, to their friends, through the avenues
of trade, and were sold by the Carthaginians? ⁰One may maintain
that postliminium does not exist in this case, and that the buyer has
the right ol ownership; with good reason because, if another view
should be held, opportunity might be given the enemy ol venting
· his rage on the captives whom allies and common friends could not
buy, seeing that in their country the captives would regain their
liberty at once. Or opportunity might be taken to send these cap· 4
tives to barbarous peoples, who were more remote, and to other
more savage enemies, from whose land return would be extremely
difficult. pFelynus fitly remarks that “ this point applies more particu·
κ larly where captives taken by infidels are concerned, from the risk
that they may be led by violence or treachery to adopt the infidel's
manner ol life.’'

Finally against Gama and against his unheard ol distinction
one ought to observe that he even speaks against a judgment ren-
dered by a College [or bench ol judges]; qand the decisions of
the Colleges are ol more weight even than those ol a most distin·
guished jurist. ‘This is the point which the Rota of Genoa makes

’ against the writer ol the decisions ol the Rota of Avignon, that the
decision was that ol the writer, not that ol the Rota. Others make
the same objection to a ruling ol Afflictis, that he stands opposed
to the rest of the College. Other writers make the same point in
other similar cases.

Now in continuing I would say ol Baldus and ol the other doctors
that he hesitates, and that all of them are talking of a proscribed
person, that i's ol a man regarded as an enemy because of an offense
which he has committed. ‘Such aman is comparable to a fugitive.
But they are not talking of an enemy who is waging war, as is the
case here. Between him and the other there are very marked difler-
ences. tLikewise they apply this doctrine when an agreement has .
been reached between allies, or when the treaty provides that the
territory ol the allies shall be regarded as a unit. And Baldus
says that an alliance has no greater and no less scope than the agree·
ments themselves cover. I maintain too that ¹one situation presents
itsell when we are dealing with punishment, which is ol course an
unpleasant thing, and which can be inflicted solely in the confines ol an
ally attached to ourselves only; but, when, as in this case, the freeing
[of people and property] is concerned, which is a beneficent act,
another situation comes up lor discussion.
