CHAPTER XXIII

Of an A praemovit Made in Consequence oy‘ F ear and Guile

If anything is found to have been done, it is the presumption
that it was done voluntarily and not through fear, because otherwise
a delict-would be presumed, ior the reason that the person who
should use fear in accomplishing his purpose would be committing
a delict. ⁸ This is the vieW, and held without qualification, too, which
Alciatus gives on other cases in dealing with the rules applying
to presumptions. However, the more difficult proof does not fall,
as it may in other cases, upon him who wishes to prove the existence
of iear in spite of that presumption of the law; for, as it is the gen·
eral custom to employ iear secretly, the easier and inferential prooi
is enough, as we have it in the same writer and on other cases. Thus
too, guile, though not presumed, is proved by inference-l’ as others
also have explained at length-and by circumstantial evidence. eEn·
cessive precautions prove the existence of guile, and here the precau-
tions are ol this kind. dGuile is proved by frequent ellorts to per·
suade one; this likcwise was the situation in the case oi Pintus. To
persuade is more than to compel. Thus, therefore, the reply has been
made that the action was the result oi guile, oi a iraudulent scheme,
and that a person using fraud in the way described is held ior dam·
ages.

eGuile is presumed on the part ol him who has acted through an
agent and has not taken care to see the contract. And the man who
had a transaction with Pintus did not take care to see under what
authority the latter might act. This is especially noticeable, since he
had heard too that Pintus did not have the authority to transact any
business whatsoever. Let them not cast up to me the clauses of this
transaction. fThey all vanish into thin air, if guile is found; rand 222
they vanish if they are understood to have been drawn up with the
same intent with which Pintus was induced to engage in the trans·

action.
