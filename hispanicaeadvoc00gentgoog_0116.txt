the opposing arguments mentioned above do not present any difficulty,
for they do not really present 3 difficulty, I reply that in my opinion
the English have the right in their favor, and that the Sardinians 3ηά
Maltese are wronging them.

Further, with reference to the other merchandise, which consti·
tutes far the largest part of the property concemed, the merchandise
outside of the contraband mentioned above, Ι think that the English
are undoubtedly right. ¹‘When lawful 3ηά unlawful merchandise
belong not to the same but to different persons, the lawful is not
confiscated on account of the unla'wful, nor is the lawful confiscated
even if both go with the same skipper. This is the view which
Cynus, Baldus, and Salycetus prefer. “This is the truth,’¹ says
Baldus. ⁰“lt is the truth,'' Bartolus says also, 3ηά Alexander
makes the same remark in commenting on Bartolus‚ 1'aud later Fe·
lynus and others express the same opinion. this is undoubtedly

the common opinion in the case where owners of lawful goods have
not known about the unlawful goods. ‘Undoubtedly he did wrong in
ignorance, as Ripa writes on this very point, 3ηά he remarks that in ·
Ι3 doubtful case ignorance is presumed, etc. Itis unreasonable to

85 think that a lawful thing should be confiscated on account of an un·
lawful one, since when things are separate and distinct the principles

applied are separate and distinct, as we find in Baldus. Itis unrea·
sonable that the hatred felt for one person should incommode an-
other, as Salycetus has it. These lines of reasoning are general 3ηά
approved everywhere. Therefore, the view would be established
also by common usage, and on this point there is a passage in Clarus.
He says that this view is the milder, and is therefore the one to be
held, and in this case Clarus is even assuming that the owner of the-⁴
lawful goods knew about the unlawful goods. Furthermore, what
others say of the man in ignorance should not be taken of one who
does not know, bu't of one who is not a partner. Otherwise, that
truth, stated by Bartolus 3ηά by others, conceming lawful property
which is not to be confiscated with unlawful property will have too
wide a scope, if it applies where both were in charge of the same skip
per. Now, Baldus, to be sure, interprets this word by writing, “ What
belongs to another is not to be confiscated, unless that other was an
accomplice in the offense.'’ Indeed this is the common opinion,
“that all property is confiscated, whether it belongs to the skipper
himself or to another, provided hc knew and consented,’' as Clarus
= reports. lt is not enough to have known, unless one shall have also
consented, 'unless one shall have been “ acquiescent,” as it stands else·
where. ‘Indeed the man who is associated with another in an of·
fense is in consequence thereof an accomplice even. Those who com·
mit a crime, and, to quote the common phrase, those who cdnsent to
