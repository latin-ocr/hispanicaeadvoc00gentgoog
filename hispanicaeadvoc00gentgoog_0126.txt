namely, the English civil law. Now, in this review of the cases ap-
pealed‚ Ι do notate, and no one else, Ι fancy, can see, what the pro·
fessors of the other kind of law could review. What if that other
¹kind of law should contain enactments contrary to those of the civil
law? dThe view of a distinguished man that a ruling given in har·
mony with the school of the interpreter should not be criticized‚
always holds good. Therefore, if the ruling of the judge of the Ad·
miralty is given in accordance with the law he professes, that is
enough. Now this is my first argument. The judges who hear the
appeal should be of the same class as the first judge. But the first
judge is a professor of English civil law. Therefore, the judges who
hear the appeal should be professors of the English civil law. eThe
judge who hears the appeal should preserve what the original judge
preserved. An appealcase is of the same nature as the original case.
‘And as God’s representative (Ι quote the very words of Oldradus)
let the judge in the appeal review the case. Should not the judge
simply pronounce the earlier decision as unjust or just? Accordingly,
the case is just the same iu the second instance as it was in the first.
97 Why should I quote that platitude to the effect that the substitute
should be of the same character as the man whose place he takes?
For the appellate judge is a sort of substitute. ⁸The setting in which
a judgment has begun should determine that in which it should end,
and this is the more creditable course to follow, and a course in har·

consideratione, a reply will presently be given to this objection.
Meanwhile the second argument will be that every passage
which could lead to different decisions on the same case should always
be blocked. ¹¹ From this comes our popular maxim that the continuity
of cases should not be broken; and that one part of a case should
nothe heard before one judge‚ and another part before another.
Then, too, the consideration is urged that different decisione should
not be given in one and the same case. ¹And so all laws always take
care that the judges be even constrained to render the same decision.
¹ Thus an odd number of judges is chosen that one decision may always
prevail. ln the same way there are numerous other points of the
same kind. But pray‚ who can doubt that those versed in the com·
mon law and those versed in the civil law will disagree? ¹“ Man·
kind's proneness to disagreement is natural.’' ¹¹¹ Those jurists have
long entertained feelings of open and inveterate hostility for one
another. Even the laws of which we are speaking disagree; yes‚ they
do. Either the laws disagree or else the expounders of the laws
disagrecd in that case which the illustrious Emperor recently decided

in harmony with our contention‚ for according to the pettifoggers
