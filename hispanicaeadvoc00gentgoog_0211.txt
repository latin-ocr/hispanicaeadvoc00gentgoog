To What Extant a res judicata May Injure a Third Party, and
concerninq His Appeal and the Impropriety of
Delayinq the Exrcuriorr

A res iudicata prejudices a third party also. ,A res iudicata
¹creates a right; it is accepted as the truth; no one is listened to who
speaks against it, etc. It even injures a third party when carried to
the point of being hall-proved, in such wisc in fact that the rest of
the case may be finished by taking an oath. bThis is the teaching of
'Bartolua which is followed by Butrius‚ Ancharanus, panormitanus,
Romanus, Alexander, Socinus, Decius, Tiraquellus, and Menochius,
who cites them all and says that the view ought not to be called
in question. cTo these writers I add Alciatus, Decianus, Purpuratus‚
Ruinus, the Rota ol Genoa, and Gozadinus, who testihes about all
of them as holding this opinion in his note tol. 2, C ode, De edicr0.²
The people who talk of the opposite opinion as the common one
are absurd. Even those who diller from Bartolus are on his side,
when there is any connection between the cases or common clement in

them, 33 there is in ours. This opinion ought to be held, as at least 182
midway between the two views, 3ηά 33 reconciling other opinions.
But if the third party is injured by the verdict‚ and does not appeal
from it, then it is transformed into 3 judgment against him.
dSometimes the third party cannot appeal; he cannot, if the
man against whom the verdict has been pronounced could not.
eWhen he can, he is surely under obligation to appeal, that is, il he
has neither protested during the trial when the other was concemed,
to prevent it harming him, nor removed from the suit the litigant
whom he could have removed. fHe ought to have appealed in that
manner and time in which he might have appealed, had he been de·
leat'ed himself, within ten days from the time when he knew that the
verdict had been pronounced, ε133 he who does not appeal at the ap·
propriate time seems to agree to a verdict and to give up the right
to appeal. Likewise negligente at least is shown on the part of one
who could use suitable remedies and has not used them. Further·
more, there is no way of going back to what has been renounced.
hWhat shall I say to the fact that without an appeal a new trial is
started by a third party, and that therefore execution ought not to
