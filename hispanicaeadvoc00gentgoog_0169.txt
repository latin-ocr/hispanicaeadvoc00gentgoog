Of Testimony Communicated in Advanee to Liuqanrs

That evidence is not invalidated when witnesses in advance have
indicated to a party concerned what they were going to depose,
²Salycetus maintains. In his judicial observations, the Palatine Chan-

“ cellor admirably remarks that it is not wrong to ask witnesses what
they know about a case, so that the party which is going to bring them
forward may in this way consider what it can prove, because it would
nothe fraudulent lor anyone to give thought to the preparation oi
prools, and this response, he says, he made to a certain noble who
inquired whether he could, without any prejudice‚ listen to certain
persons concerning a case before he began the action. Thus the
truth stands.

¹³Still I know that Albericus Rosatus teaches that the statement
of those witnesses who repeat their evidence to the parties concerned
seems to have no validity. ρΑΙεο the glossator remarks that no cre-
dence is given to those who have disclosed their testimony to both
parties, and again with the glossator stand Albericus and Fulgosius.
Observe, says Fulgosius, that when the deposition of a wit·
ness is finishcd‚ his evidence, even when properly given, loses its
credibility from what he has done afterward. The reason lor this
is dthat in such a case it is taken lor granted that he was under an
agreement. Otherwise testimony properly given ought not to lose
its validity. Now, someone will say, if the subsequent disclosure of
testimony which hasbeen given proves that there was an agreement
about giving it, still more the disclosure and the communication in
advance of testimony to be given will prove that it was given under
an agreement, since the sequence from antecedent to subsequent
events is more natural than the reverse process.

But notice this point first, that the law has been badly under·
stood by the glossator, by Albericus, Fulgosius, ‘Baldua Flori-
anus, Speculator‚ and any others there may be-the law, I mean,
from which they draw their conclusion with reference to this dis· 140
closure or announcement in advance. “ Those who have given untrue
or contradictory evidence, or have given evidence (prodiderunt) ior
each side are properly punished by judges.'’ This is the law in
which they wrongly think that prodiderunt means they have disclosed.
Prodere testimonium utrique parti means to give testimony lor each
