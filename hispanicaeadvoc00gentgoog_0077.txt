The Pleas of a Spanish Advocate, Bk. l. 51

to another the receipt coming from the debtor who would agree that
he owed one hundred per cent. interest, and in this way it would be
easy for a money-lender to exact usurious interest indirectly. We
hold just this view, that it would be easy for the pirates to transfer
property captured in piracy to another person whom they might
have with them, as our pirates had thisman with them. So it could ·
be pretended that what they could not have kept was given to him
by the pirates. rFor while they might seem to have bee'n wicked
in giving it, still he might not seem to have been wicked in receiving it,
although he might have done the plundering himself aethe enemy of
those who were robbed.

But I make this point, too, against this man, that he would also be
a pirate here under the edict of our King, in which a sbip is con-
sidered piratical which has more Englishmen than foreigners. This
is the case about which the discussion arises. But if a ship is piratical,
then all who play any part on it are pirates, and consequently he is
a pirate. ⁸0f course, what is held concerning a ship is to be ac·
cepted with reference to the sailors. ¹¹No ship of itself ever injured
anybody‚ as Augustus said.

The edict of the King is not to be applied to the English only3
for ample provisions had been made for them even before the 40
edict was promulgated. Resides, one cannot deny in this case the
power of tbe King over this partner of his Britons on the ground
that he was not the subject of the King, because it is enough to hold
him, that he had made himself the partner or the captain of these
subjects, for as this man could not do these wrongs to the Spaniards
inlthe'territory of our King, so he cannot do them in cooperation
with our King’s men. ¹See the argument which the doctors often
use in passing from a placeto a person and vice versa, the argument
which Baldus also uses in a strict sense concerning a subject place and
subject persons. .¹‘He becomes guilty of parricide who gives assist-
ance in committing parricide3 of breaking the peace, who gives assist-
ance to one who is breaking the peace3 of violation of sovereignty‚
who aids a subject in committing that wrong. Consequently‚ a man
who may not be a pirate, so far as his own actions are concerned‚
may be one through the actions ol his associatos, and may be at
least held under the civil law to return that which he has received
from pirates. ¹See‚ says Sotus‚ how much danger there is in having
business relations with usurers (we make the same statement, too, of
thieves); see how their subordinatas may be held to restore the
wages received from them.

Sotus says also, in view of the fact that the ownership' of
stolen money may not be transferred to a thief, that it follows that
whoever should sell bread to a thief should be required to restore the
