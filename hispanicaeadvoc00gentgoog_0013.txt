TRANSLATOR’S PREFATORY REMARKS

THE TEXT

The unique character of the 'Hispanico Advocatio among the
legal writings of its time, in so far as it has a bearing on the rask of
the translator, deserves a word of comment here. As is well known,
the book was brought out several years after Alberico Gentili’s death,
by his brother Scipione. Consequently it did not have the benefit of
a final revision at the author’s hands. This fact may explain in part
the comparatively large number of errors which the text seems to
show. lf Alberico had lived to publish the book, very likely also
he would not have contented himself with bringing out his work in
the form which it takes, of notes on the cases in which he interested
himself, buthe would have expanded his summaries into detailed
arguments. Inasmuch as many of Gentili's cases are presented in
this very condensed form, with reasons rather suggested than directly
stated, and with sentences occasionally given only in part, and since
the argument usually presupposes a knowledge ol facts with which
the court was familiar, but of which we are sometimes ignorant, the
logical connection and the meaning ol a sentence is at times left in
doubt. The reader is requested to bear these facts in mind, if at any
point his understanding of the meaning· of the Latin text differs from
that of the translator. Corrections and emendations necessary from
the point of view of the translator are listed at the end ol Volume l.

MODE OF CITATION EMPLOYED BT GENTlLl

The marginal references for a particular chapter in the Latin
text are grouped at the end of the chapter in the translation, and
at the end of this book there will be found a list of the authors and
books cited by Gentili in these references or in the body ol the text.
The citations may be conveniently classified under four heads-refer· ’
ences to the Civil Law, to the Canon Law, to Commentaries on the
civil or Canon Law, and to other authorities.

For the Corpus Iuris Civilis Krueger’s edition of the Institutes
and of the Justinian Code, Mommsen's edition of the Digest, and
the Schoell-Kroll text of the Novels are the most satisfactory. Our
practice today in making citations from the Civil Law is to pass

from the larger division to the subdivision. Thus D. 49, ις, 19, 3
